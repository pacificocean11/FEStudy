Typically, head decreases as flow increases. The highest head occurs at zero flow (shut-off head).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. System Curve</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Plots the Head required by the piping system versus Flow Rate. It consists of static head (elevation lift) plus friction losses.</p>\n$$ H_{sys} = H_{static} + K Q^2 $$\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Operating Point</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The point where the Pump Curve and System Curve intersect. This determines the actual flow rate and head for that specific pump in that specific system.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Other Curves</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Manufacturers also provide curves for Efficiency ($\\eta$) vs $Q$ and Power ($BHP$) vs $Q$. The best operating point is near the Best Efficiency Point (BEP).</p>\n",
