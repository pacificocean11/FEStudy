Head Loss (Major Loss)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">As a fluid flows through a pipe, it loses energy due to friction between the fluid and the pipe wall, and between the fluid layers themselves. This energy loss manifests as a pressure drop along the pipe. In fluid mechanics, this is often expressed as 'head loss' ($h_L$), which is the equivalent height of a fluid column that would represent this energy loss.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Darcy-Weisbach Equation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The major head loss due to friction in a length of pipe is calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:</p>\n$$ h_L = f \\frac{L}{D} \\frac{v^2}{2g} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$h_L$ is the head loss (in meters or feet).</li>\n    <li>$f$ is the Darcy friction factor (dimensionless).</li>\n    <li>$L$ is the length of the pipe.</li>\n    <li>$D$ is the diameter of the pipe.</li>\n    <li>$v$ is the mean velocity of the fluid.</li>\n    <li>$g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Friction Factor (f)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The friction factor $f$ depends on the flow regime (i.e., the Reynolds number) and the relative roughness of the pipe wall ($\epsilon/D$).</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Laminar Flow ($Re < 2300$):</strong> The friction factor depends only on the Reynolds number and is independent of surface roughness.</li>\n    $$ f = \\frac{64}{Re} $$\n    <li><strong>Turbulent Flow ($Re > 4000$):</strong> The friction factor is a complex function of both the Reynolds number and the relative roughness. It is typically found using the <strong>Moody Chart</strong> or by solving the Colebrook equation (which is implicit and difficult to solve by hand).</li>\n</ul>\n",
