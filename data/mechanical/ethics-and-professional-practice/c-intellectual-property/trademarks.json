  "notes": "\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">1. Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>trademark</strong> (or service mark) is a word, phrase, symbol, design, or a combination thereof that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others. A service mark distinguishes the source of a service rather than goods.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Purpose of Trademarks</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The primary purpose of a trademark is to prevent consumer confusion by indicating the source of a product or service. It helps consumers associate a product with a specific quality and producer.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Trademark Symbols</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>™ (Trademark Symbol):</strong> Used for unregistered trademarks to promote or brand goods.</li>\n    <li><strong>℠ (Service Mark Symbol):</strong> Used for unregistered service marks to promote or brand services.</li>\n    <li><strong>® (Registered Trademark Symbol):</strong> Used only for trademarks that have been officially registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Term of Protection</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A trademark can potentially last forever, as long as it is continuously used in commerce and defended against infringement. It must be renewed periodically, typically every 10 years after the initial registration.</p>\n",
