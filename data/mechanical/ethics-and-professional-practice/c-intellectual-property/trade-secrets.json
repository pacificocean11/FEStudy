  "notes": "\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">1. Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>trade secret</strong> is any practice or process of a company that is generally not known outside of the company. It is information that a company has taken reasonable steps to keep secret and that provides a competitive business advantage.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. What Constitutes a Trade Secret</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Trade secrets can include a wide variety of information, such as:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>Formulas (e.g., the formula for Coca-Cola)</li>\n    <li>Manufacturing processes</li>\n    <li>Customer lists</li>\n    <li>Business strategies and plans</li>\n    <li>Computer algorithms not disclosed in a patent</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Protection</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Unlike patents, trade secrets are not registered with any government agency. Protection lasts indefinitely, as long as the information remains confidential and is not discovered by others through legitimate means. The primary methods of protection include:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs):</strong> Legal contracts between parties not to disclose confidential information.</li>\n    <li><strong>Internal Security Measures:</strong> Restricting access to the information, using secure computer systems, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">If a trade secret is acquired through improper means (e.g., industrial espionage, breach of contract), the owner can take legal action. However, if a competitor independently develops or reverse-engineers the secret, there is no protection.</p>\n",
