Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>copyright</strong> is a legal right that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights for its use and distribution. It is a form of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. What Copyright Protects</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Copyright protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. It applies to works that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression, such as:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>Literary works (books, articles, software source code)</li>\n    <li>Musical works, including any accompanying words</li>\n    <li>Dramatic works, including any accompanying music</li>\n    <li>Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works (engineering drawings, blueprints, photographs)</li>\n    <li>Motion pictures and other audiovisual works</li>\n    <li>Sound recordings</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Term of Protection</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For works created by an individual, copyright protection typically lasts for the <strong>life of the author plus an additional 70 years</strong>. For works made for hire or anonymous/pseudonymous works, the copyright term is 95 years from the year of its first publication or 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever expires first.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Fair Use</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Fair use is a doctrine in United States law that permits limited use of copyrighted material without having to first acquire permission from the copyright holder. Examples include use for criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.</p>\n",
