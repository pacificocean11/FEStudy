  "notes": "\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">1. The Paramount Rule</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The fundamental canon of all engineering codes of ethics (including NCEES, NSPE, and ASME) is that <strong>engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public</strong>. This obligation supersedes all duties to clients, employers, or the profession itself.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Determining \"The Public\"</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The \"public\" includes anyone who may be affected by an engineer's work. This includes:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>Users of the product or structure.</li>\n    <li>People living or working nearby.</li>\n    <li>Future generations (sustainability).</li>\n    <li>The environment (often considered part of public welfare).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Obligations and Whistleblowing</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">If an engineer's professional judgment is overruled under circumstances that endanger life, health, property, or public welfare, they have specific ethical obligations:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Notify:</strong> They must notify their employer, client, and such other authority as may be appropriate.</li>\n    <li><strong>Refuse:</strong> They must typically refuse to sign or seal documents that violate safe engineering standards.</li>\n    <li><strong>Whistleblowing:</strong> Determining when to report safety violations to external authorities involves weighing the severity of the harm, the immediacy of the threat, and whether internal channels have been exhausted.</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "question": "An engineer is designing a pressure vessel. The client demands the use of a cheaper material that does not meet the safety requirements of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The client is willing to sign a waiver releasing the engineer from liability. What should the engineer do?",

        { "text": "Proceed with the design, as the waiver protects them legally.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Refuse to complete the design and explain that code requirements regarding safety cannot be waived.", "isCorrect": true },

        { "text": "Report the client to the police immediately.", "isCorrect": false }

      "explanation": "The engineer's obligation to public safety is paramount and cannot be waived by a client. Designing a vessel that violates safety codes is unethical and likely illegal, regardless of any liability waivers."
