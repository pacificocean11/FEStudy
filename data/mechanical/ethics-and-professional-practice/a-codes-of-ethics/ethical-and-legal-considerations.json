Ethics vs. Law</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">It is important to understand the difference between ethical and legal standards.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Legal standards</strong> are based on laws and regulations written by government bodies. An action is legal if it does not violate a law. Breaking a law can result in fines, imprisonment, and loss of license.</li>\n    <li><strong>Ethical standards</strong> are based on a set of professional norms and principles (like the codes of ethics). An action can be legal but still be unethical. Violating ethical standards can result in disciplinary action from a professional society or state board.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Ethics generally represents a higher standard of conduct than the law.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Conflict of Interest</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A conflict of interest occurs when an engineer's personal interests (e.g., financial, familial) have the potential to interfere with their professional judgment and their duty to a client or employer. Engineers have an ethical obligation to disclose any potential conflicts of interest to their clients and employers and to avoid situations where such conflicts could compromise their work.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Confidentiality</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Engineers must not reveal facts, data, or information obtained in a professional capacity without the prior consent of the client or employer except as authorized or required by law or the code of ethics. This duty of confidentiality is a core part of acting as a faithful agent.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">However, this duty is not absolute. The obligation to protect the public welfare supersedes the duty of confidentiality. If a client's confidential information reveals a danger to the public, the engineer may be ethically obligated to disclose it to the proper authorities.</p>\n",
