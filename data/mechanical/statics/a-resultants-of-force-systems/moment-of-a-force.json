Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>moment of a force</strong> (often called torque) is a measure of its tendency to cause a body to rotate about a specific point or axis. It is a vector quantity.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Scalar Calculation (2D)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In a 2D plane, the moment ($M_O$) of a force $\\mathbf{F}$ about a point O is calculated as the magnitude of the force multiplied by the perpendicular distance from the point to the line of action of the force. This perpendicular distance is called the <strong>moment arm ($d$)</strong>.</p>\n$$ M_O = F \\cdot d $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The direction is determined by convention, usually counter-clockwise (CCW) is positive and clockwise (CW) is negative.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Vector Calculation (3D)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A more general method for calculating the moment of a force about a point O is using the cross product. The moment vector $\\mathbf{M}_O$ is the cross product of the position vector $\\mathbf{r}$ (from the point O to any point on the line of action of the force) and the force vector $\\mathbf{F}$.</p>\n$$ \\mathbf{M}_O = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The direction of the moment vector is perpendicular to the plane containing $\\mathbf{r}$ and $\\mathbf{F}$, and its direction is given by the right-hand rule.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Varignon's Theorem</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Varignon's theorem, or the principle of moments, states that the moment of a force about any point is equal to the sum of the moments of its components about the same point. This is often easier than finding the perpendicular distance, $d$.</p>\n$$ M_O = F_y \\cdot d_x - F_x \\cdot d_y $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Where $F_x$ and $F_y$ are components of the force, and $d_x$ and $d_y$ are the x and y distances from the point to the point of force application.</p>\n",
