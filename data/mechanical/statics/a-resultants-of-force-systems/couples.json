Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>couple</strong> is a system of two parallel forces that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. A couple produces a pure moment (rotation) without any net translation, because the resultant force of a couple is zero ($\mathbf{F} + (-\mathbf{F}) = 0$).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Moment of a Couple</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The moment produced by a couple ($M$) is the magnitude of one of the forces ($F$) multiplied by the perpendicular distance ($d$) between their lines of action.</p>\n$$ M = F \\cdot d $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">An important property of a couple is that its moment is a <strong>free vector</strong>. This means the moment of a couple is the same about *any* point. It does not depend on where you calculate the moment from.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Equivalent Systems</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Any force $\\mathbf{F}$ acting at a point A can be moved to another point B by adding a couple. The equivalent system at point B will consist of the same force $\\mathbf{F}$ and a couple of moment $\\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{r}_{BA} \\times \\mathbf{F}$, where $\\mathbf{r}_{BA}$ is the position vector from the new point B to the original point A.</p>\n",

      "question": "The moment of a couple is considered a 'free vector'. What does this mean?",

        { "text": "It can be applied anywhere without changing its effect.", "isCorrect": true },

      "explanation": "A free vector is a vector whose effect is independent of its point of application. The rotational effect (moment) of a couple is the same regardless of which point on the rigid body the moment is calculated about."
