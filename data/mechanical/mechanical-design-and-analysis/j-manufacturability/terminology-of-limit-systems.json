Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Limit systems are used in engineering drawings to define the acceptable range of variation for the dimensions of a manufactured part. This ensures that parts are interchangeable and will fit together as intended.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Key Terminology</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Basic Size:</strong> The theoretical, exact size from which limits of size are derived. It is the size shown on the drawing (e.g., 25 mm).</li>\n    <li><strong>Actual Size:</strong> The size of the finished part as measured.</li>\n    <li><strong>Limits of Size:</strong> The maximum and minimum permissible sizes for a feature.\n        <ul class=\"list-circle list-inside ml-6\">\n            <li><strong>Maximum Limit of Size:</strong> The largest acceptable size.</li>\n            <li><strong>Minimum Limit of Size:</strong> The smallest acceptable size.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Tolerance:</strong> The total amount a specific dimension is permitted to vary. It is the difference between the maximum and minimum limits of size. Tolerance is always a positive value.</li>\n    <li><strong>Deviation:</strong> The algebraic difference between a size (actual, max, or min) and the corresponding basic size.\n        <ul class=\"list-circle list-inside ml-6\">\n            <li><strong>Upper Deviation:</strong> Maximum Limit - Basic Size.</li>\n            <li><strong>Lower Deviation:</strong> Minimum Limit - Basic Size.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Allowance:</strong> The intentional difference between the maximum material conditions of mating parts. It is the minimum clearance (for clearance fits) or maximum interference (for interference fits).</li>\n</ul>\n",
