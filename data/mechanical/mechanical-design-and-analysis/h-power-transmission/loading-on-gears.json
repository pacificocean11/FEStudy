Forces on a Spur Gear Tooth</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The total force ($F_N$) between two mating gear teeth acts along the line of action, at the pressure angle ($\\phi$) to the tangent of the pitch circles. This total force can be resolved into two perpendicular components:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Tangential Force ($W_t$):</strong> This is the useful component that transmits power. It is tangent to the pitch circle. It can be calculated from the torque ($T$) and the pitch radius ($r$).</li>\n    $$W_t = \\frac{T}{r} = \\frac{2T}{d}$$\n    <li><strong>Radial Force ($W_r$):</strong> This component acts radially towards the center of the gear. It does not transmit power but is important for bearing and shaft design. It is related to the tangential force by the pressure angle.</li>\n    $$W_r = W_t \\tan(\\phi)$$\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The total force is the vector sum of these components: $F_N = \\sqrt{W_t^2 + W_r^2} = W_t / \\cos(\\phi)$.</p>\n",
