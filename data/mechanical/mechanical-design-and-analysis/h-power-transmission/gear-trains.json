They are used to change speed, torque, and direction of rotation.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Simple Gear Train</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A simple gear train is one where each shaft carries only one gear. The <strong>velocity ratio (VR)</strong> or <strong>gear ratio</strong> is the ratio of the input speed to the output speed.</p>\n$$VR = \\frac{\\omega_{in}}{\\omega_{out}} = \\frac{N_{out}}{N_{in}}$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">where $\\omega$ is angular velocity and $N$ is the number of teeth. Note that the gear with more teeth spins slower.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">An <strong>idler gear</strong> can be placed between the input and output gears. It changes the direction of rotation but does not affect the magnitude of the overall velocity ratio.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Compound Gear Train</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A compound gear train is one where at least one shaft carries more than one gear. The overall velocity ratio is the product of the velocity ratios of each simple gear pair in the train.</p>\n$$VR_{total} = VR_1 \\cdot VR_2 \\cdot ... = \\left(\\frac{N_{driven1}}{N_{driver1}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{N_{driven2}}{N_{driver2}}\\right) \\cdot ...$$\n$$VR_{total} = \\frac{\\text{Product of number of teeth on driven gears}}{\\text{Product of number of teeth on driver gears}}$$\n",

      "explanation": "Use the velocity ratio formula: $\\frac{\\omega_{in}}{\\omega_{out}} = \\frac{N_{out}}{N_{in}}$.\n$\\frac{1800 \\text{ rpm}}{\\omega_{out}} = \\frac{60}{20} = 3$. Solving for $\\omega_{out}$: $\\omega_{out} = \\frac{1800}{3} = 600$ rpm."
