This is known as variable loading or fatigue loading. Such a stress cycle can be characterized by a mean stress ($\\sigma_m$) and an alternating or amplitude stress ($\\sigma_a$).</p>\n$$ \\sigma_m = \\frac{\\sigma_{max} + \\sigma_{min}}{2} $$$$ \\sigma_a = \\frac{\\sigma_{max} - \\sigma_{min}}{2} $$\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Fatigue Failure Criteria with Mean Stress</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The endurance limit ($S_e$) is determined for a completely reversed stress ($\\sigma_m=0$). When a non-zero mean stress is present, the fatigue life is reduced. Several criteria have been developed to predict failure under these conditions. They are often plotted on a diagram of alternating stress vs. mean stress.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Soderberg Line (Very Conservative):</strong> A straight line connecting the endurance limit ($S_e$) on the alternating stress axis to the yield strength ($S_y$) on the mean stress axis. It guards against any possibility of yielding.</li>\n    $$ \\frac{\\sigma_a}{S_e} + \\frac{\\sigma_m}{S_y} = \\frac{1}{n} $$\n    <li><strong>Goodman Line (Conservative):</strong> A straight line connecting $S_e$ on the alternating axis to the ultimate tensile strength ($S_{ut}$) on the mean stress axis. Widely used.</li>\n    $$ \\frac{\\sigma_a}{S_e} + \\frac{\\sigma_m}{S_{ut}} = \\frac{1}{n} $$\n    <li><strong>Gerber Line (Parabolic):</strong> A parabola connecting $S_e$ to $S_{ut}$. It more accurately fits experimental data for many materials but is more complex to calculate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In these equations, $n$ is the factor of safety.</p>\n",
