Brittle Material Behavior</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Brittle materials, such as cast iron, ceramics, and glass, are characterized by their lack of significant plastic deformation before fracture. A key characteristic is that their ultimate strength in compression ($S_{uc}$) is much greater than their ultimate strength in tension ($S_{ut}$). They fail by sudden, catastrophic fracture.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Maximum Normal Stress (MNS) Theory</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Also known as Rankine's theory, this is the simplest and most common theory for brittle materials. It predicts that failure occurs when one of the principal stresses reaches the ultimate strength of the material.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Let $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_3$ be the maximum and minimum principal stresses, respectively. Failure is predicted if:</p>\n$$ \\sigma_1 \\ge S_{ut} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad |\\sigma_3| \\ge |S_{uc}| $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This theory is most accurate when the principal stresses are in the first or third quadrants of the $\\sigma_1$-$\\sigma_3$ stress space.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Modified-Mohr (MM) Theory</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The Modified-Mohr theory provides a more accurate prediction for all stress states. It uses a failure envelope based on Mohr's circles for tensile, compressive, and pure shear tests. It correctly accounts for the difference in tensile and compressive strengths.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The factor of safety ($n$) for a given stress state can be calculated based on this theory. For the exam, it is most important to know that this theory is more accurate than MNS but also more complex.</p>\n",

      "question": "Which statement is true for most brittle materials?",
      "options": [
        { "text": "They have equal strength in tension and compression.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "They are much stronger in tension than in compression.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "They are much stronger in compression than in tension.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "They fail by yielding, not fracture.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Brittle materials can withstand much higher compressive stresses than tensile stresses. Microscopic cracks and flaws within the material are easily propagated by tensile stress, but compressive stress tends to close these cracks, preventing failure."

      "question": "A cast iron component has an ultimate tensile strength of 30 ksi and an ultimate compressive strength of 100 ksi. It is subjected to a stress state where the principal stresses are $\\sigma_1 = 25$ ksi and $\\sigma_3 = -80$ ksi. According to the Maximum Normal Stress theory, will it fail?",
      "options": [
        { "text": "Yes, because $\\sigma_1 > S_{ut}$.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "No, because both principal stresses are below the limits.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "Yes, because $|\\sigma_3| > S_{ut}$.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Cannot be determined.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "We check both conditions of the MNS theory. Is $\\sigma_1 \\ge S_{ut}$? No, because $25 < 30$. Is $|\\sigma_3| \\ge |S_{uc}|$? No, because $80 < 100$. Since neither condition for failure is met, the theory predicts that the component will not fail."
