Curvilinear Motion</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">When a particle moves along a curved path, its acceleration vector can be resolved into two components that are more intuitive for describing the motion: a tangential component and a normal component.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The total acceleration vector is the sum of these two components: $\\b a = \\b a_t + \\b a_n$.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8zH4JgP.png\" alt=\"Diagram of tangential and normal acceleration components\" class=\"mx-auto my-4 rounded-lg bg-white p-2 shadow\">\n<p class=\"text-sm text-center text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 mb-4\">Fig 1: The velocity vector ($\\vec{v}$) is tangent to the path. The acceleration vector ($\\vec{a}$) can be broken into a tangential component ($\\vec{a}_t$), which changes the speed, and a normal component ($\\vec{a}_n$), which changes the direction.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Tangential Acceleration ($\\b a_t$)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The tangential component of acceleration acts along the tangent to the path of motion. It is responsible for the <strong>change in the particle's speed</strong>.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>The magnitude is given by the rate of change of speed: $a_t = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\dot{v}$.</li>\n    <li>If speed is increasing, $a_t$ is in the direction of motion.</li>\n    <li>If speed is decreasing (deceleration), $a_t$ is opposite to the direction of motion.</li>\n    <li>If speed is constant, $a_t = 0$.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Normal Acceleration ($\\b a_n$)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The normal (or centripetal) component of acceleration acts perpendicular to the tangent, pointing towards the center of curvature of the path. It is responsible for the <strong>change in the direction of the particle's velocity</strong>.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>The magnitude is given by: $a_n = \\frac{v^2}{\\rho}$, where $v$ is the speed and $\\rho$ (rho) is the radius of curvature of the path at that point.</li>\n    <li>For motion in a circle of radius $r$, $\\rho = r$.</li>\n    <li>If the particle is moving in a straight line, $\\rho \\to \\infty$ and $a_n = 0$.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uG9z3iR.png\" alt=\"Diagram of acceleration at constant speed\" class=\"mx-auto my-4 rounded-lg bg-white p-2 shadow\">\n<p class=\"text-sm text-center text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 mb-4\">Fig 2: For an object moving at constant speed along a curve, the tangential acceleration is zero, and the only acceleration is the normal (centripetal) acceleration, which points toward the center of curvature.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Total Acceleration</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Since the tangential and normal components are perpendicular, the magnitude of the total acceleration can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:</p>\n$$||\\b a|| = \\sqrt{a_t^2 + a_n^2}$$\n",
