When Acceleration is Not Constant</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In many real-world scenarios, acceleration is not constant but varies with time, position, or velocity. In these cases, the simple kinematic equations for constant acceleration cannot be used. Instead, we must use calculus (integration and differentiation).</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Fundamental Calculus Relationships</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The definitions of velocity and acceleration are the starting point:</p>\n$$a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} \quad \quad v(t) = \frac{ds}{dt}$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">From these, we can derive the integral relationships:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Finding Velocity from Acceleration:</strong> If acceleration is a function of time, $a(t)$, we can find the change in velocity by integrating:</li>\n    $$\Delta v = v_f - v_i = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} a(t) dt$$\n    <li><strong>Finding Position from Velocity:</strong> If velocity is a function of time, $v(t)$, we can find the change in position (displacement) by integrating:</li>\n    $$\Delta s = s_f - s_i = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} v(t) dt$$\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Acceleration as a Function of Position</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A third useful relationship, $a ds = v dv$, can be derived from the fundamental definitions. This is useful when acceleration is given as a function of position, $a(s)$. We can integrate it as:</p>\n$$\int_{s_i}^{s_f} a(s) ds = \int_{v_i}^{v_f} v dv = \frac{1}{2}(v_f^2 - v_i^2)$$\n",

      ],
      "explanation": "Here, acceleration is a function of velocity. We use $a = dv/dt$. The equation is $\frac{dv}{dt} = -2v$. This is a separable differential equation: $\frac{dv}{v} = -2dt$. Integrating both sides gives $\ln(v) = -2t + C$. Exponentiating gives $v = e^{-2t+C} = e^C e^{-2t} = K e^{-2t}$. Using the initial condition $v(0)=10$, we have $10 = K e^0 \implies K=10$. So, $v(t) = 10e^{-2t}$. At $t=1$, $v(1) = 10e^{-2}$ m/s."
