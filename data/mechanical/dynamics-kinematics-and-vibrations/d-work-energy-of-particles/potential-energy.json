It is associated with conservative forces, where the work done by the force is independent of the path taken.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Gravitational Potential Energy ($U_g$)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This is the energy an object has due to its position in a gravitational field. For an object of mass $m$ at a height $h$ above a reference datum (where potential energy is defined to be zero), the gravitational potential energy is:</p>\n$$U_g = mgh$$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$m$ is mass (kg).</li>\n    <li>$g$ is the acceleration due to gravity ($\approx 9.81$ m/s²).</li>\n    <li>$h$ is the height (m) above the reference level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Elastic Potential Energy ($U_e$)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This is the energy stored in an elastic object, like a spring, when it is stretched or compressed. According to Hooke's Law, the force required to stretch or compress a spring by a distance $x$ from its equilibrium position is $F = kx$. The potential energy stored in the spring is:</p>\n$$U_e = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$k$ is the spring constant in Newtons per meter (N/m).</li>\n    <li>$x$ is the displacement (stretch or compression) from the spring's natural, unstretched length, in meters (m).</li>\n</ul>\n",
