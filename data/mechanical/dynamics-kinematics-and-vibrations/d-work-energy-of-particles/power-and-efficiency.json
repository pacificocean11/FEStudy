It is a measure of how quickly work can be performed. Power is a scalar quantity.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Formulas for Power</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Average Power:</strong> The total work done divided by the total time taken.</li>\n    $$\bar{P} = \frac{W}{\Delta t}$$\n    <li><strong>Instantaneous Power:</strong> The rate of doing work at a specific moment. It is the derivative of work with respect to time.</li>\n    $$P = \frac{dW}{dt}$$\n    <p>For an object moving with velocity $\b v$ under the action of a force $\b F$, the power delivered by that force is:</p>\n    $$P = \b F \cdot \b v = Fv\cos(\theta)$$\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Units of Power</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>The SI unit of power is the <strong>watt (W)</strong>, where $1 \text{ W} = 1 \text{ Joule/second}$.</li>\n    <li>Another common unit is <strong>horsepower (hp)</strong>. $1 \text{ hp} \approx 746 \text{ W}$.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Efficiency ($\eta$)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The efficiency of a machine or process is the ratio of the useful power output to the total power input. It is a dimensionless quantity, often expressed as a percentage.</p>\n$$\eta = \frac{\text{Power out}}{\text{Power in}} = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} = \frac{W_{out}}{W_{in}}$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Due to energy losses (e.g., from friction, heat), the efficiency is always less than 1 (or 100%). The power lost is $P_{loss} = P_{in} - P_{out}$.</p>\n",

      "explanation": "First, calculate the work done against gravity: $W = Fd = (mg)d = (500 \text{ kg})(9.8 \text{ m/s²})(20 \text{ m}) = 98,000 \text{ J}$. Then, calculate the average power: $\bar{P} = \frac{W}{\Delta t} = \frac{98,000 \text{ J}}{10 \text{ s}} = 9800 \text{ W}$ or 9.8 kW."

      "explanation": "Use the formula for instantaneous power: $P = Fv$. The force and velocity are in the same direction, so $\cos(\theta)=1$. $P = (2000 \text{ N})(30 \text{ m/s}) = 60,000 \text{ W}$ or 60 kW."
