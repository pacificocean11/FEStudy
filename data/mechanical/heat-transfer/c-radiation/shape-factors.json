Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>shape factor</strong>, also known as the view factor or configuration factor, is a purely geometric quantity that describes how well two surfaces can see each other. The shape factor from surface $i$ to surface $j$, denoted $F_{ij}$, is defined as the fraction of the radiation leaving surface $i$ that strikes surface $j$ directly.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The value of $F_{ij}$ ranges from 0 to 1.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Shape Factor Rules</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Two important rules govern shape factors for surfaces that form an enclosure:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>\n        <strong>Summation Rule:</strong> The sum of the shape factors from surface $i$ to all surfaces in the enclosure (including itself, if it's concave) must equal 1.\n        $$\\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{ij} = 1$$\n        If a surface $i$ is flat or convex, it cannot see itself, so $F_{ii} = 0$.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <strong>Reciprocity Rule:</strong> This rule relates the shape factors between two surfaces using their areas ($A$).\n        $$A_i F_{ij} = A_j F_{ji}$$\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Example: Parallel Plates</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For two large, parallel plates (1 and 2), all radiation leaving one plate will strike the other (ignoring edge effects). Therefore, $F_{12} = 1$ and $F_{21} = 1$.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">Example: Long Concentric Cylinders</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Consider a long inner cylinder (1) inside a long outer cylinder (2). All radiation leaving the inner cylinder must strike the outer cylinder, so $F_{12} = 1$. The inner cylinder is convex, so $F_{11}=0$. The outer cylinder (2) can see both the inner cylinder (1) and itself. We can find $F_{21}$ using reciprocity: $A_1 F_{12} = A_2 F_{21} \implies (2\\pi r_1 L)(1) = (2\\pi r_2 L)F_{21} \implies F_{21} = r_1/r_2$. Using the summation rule for surface 2: $F_{21} + F_{22} = 1 \implies F_{22} = 1 - F_{21} = 1 - r_1/r_2$.</p>\n",
