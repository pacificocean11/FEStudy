Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>Number of Transfer Units (NTU)</strong> is a dimensionless parameter used in the analysis of heat exchangers. It provides a measure of the thermal size or heat transfer capability of the heat exchanger.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A larger NTU value corresponds to a heat exchanger that can transfer more heat for given fluid flow rates and inlet temperatures. In essence, it is a measure of how effective the heat exchanger is at transferring heat, independent of the temperature differences.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Formula</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">NTU is defined as the ratio of the overall heat transfer conductance ($UA$) to the minimum heat capacity rate ($C_{min}$):</p>\n$$NTU = \\frac{UA}{C_{min}}$$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$U$ is the overall heat transfer coefficient (W/m²K).</li>\n    <li>$A$ is the heat transfer surface area (m²).</li>\n    <li>$C_{min}$ is the minimum heat capacity rate of the two fluids ($C_{min} = \\min(\\dot{m}_h c_{p,h}, \\dot{m}_c c_{p,c})$) in W/K.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A high NTU value can be achieved by having a large surface area ($A$), a high overall heat transfer coefficient ($U$), or a low minimum heat capacity rate ($C_{min}$).</p>\n",
