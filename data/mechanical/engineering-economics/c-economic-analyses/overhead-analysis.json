Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Overhead costs</strong>, also known as indirect costs or burden, are expenses that are not directly attributable to a specific product or project but are necessary for the general operation of the business. Examples include rent, utilities, administrative salaries, marketing, and depreciation on general-purpose equipment.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Overhead Allocation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">To determine the full cost of a product, these indirect overhead costs must be allocated to the products or projects. This is typically done using a predetermined <strong>overhead rate</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Calculating the Overhead Rate</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The overhead rate is calculated by dividing the total estimated overhead costs for a period by an allocation base.</p>\n$$ \\text{Overhead Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Total Estimated Overhead Costs}}{\\text{Total Estimated Allocation Base}} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The allocation base should be a measure that is related to the incurrence of overhead costs. Common bases include:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>Direct labor hours</li>\n    <li>Direct labor cost</li>\n    <li>Machine hours</li>\n    <li>Direct material cost</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Once the rate is determined, the overhead applied to a specific job is calculated as: Overhead Applied = Overhead Rate × Actual amount of allocation base used by the job.</p>\n",
