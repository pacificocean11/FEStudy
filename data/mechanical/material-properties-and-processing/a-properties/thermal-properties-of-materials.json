Key Properties</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Thermal Conductivity (k):</strong> A measure of a material's ability to conduct heat. Materials with high thermal conductivity (like metals) transfer heat quickly, while materials with low thermal conductivity (like foam insulation) transfer heat slowly. Units are W/m·K.</li>\n    <li><strong>Coefficient of Thermal Expansion ($\\alpha$):</strong> Describes how the size of an object changes with a change in temperature. Most materials expand when heated and contract when cooled. Units are 1/°C or 1/K.</li>\n    <li><strong>Specific Heat ($c_p$):</strong> The amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by one degree. A material with a high specific heat (like water) can absorb a lot of heat with only a small temperature change. Units are J/kg·K.</li>\n</ul>\n",
