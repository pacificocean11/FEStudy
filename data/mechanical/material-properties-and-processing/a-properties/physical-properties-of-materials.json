Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Physical properties are characteristics of a material that can be observed or measured without changing the material's chemical composition.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Key Properties</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Density ($\\rho$):</strong> The mass of a material per unit volume. It is a measure of how compact the material is. Units are kg/m³.</li>\n    <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> The temperature at which a material changes from a solid to a liquid state at a given pressure.</li>\n    <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> The temperature at which a liquid changes to a gas (vapor) at a given pressure.</li>\n    <li><strong>Color, Luster, Odor:</strong> Qualitative properties that can be used to identify a substance.</li>\n</ul>\n",
