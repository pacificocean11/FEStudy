Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In thermodynamics, a <strong>critical point</strong> (or critical state) is the end point of a phase equilibrium curve. It specifies the conditions of temperature and pressure (the critical temperature and critical pressure) at which the liquid and gas phases of a substance become indistinguishable.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Supercritical Fluid</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">At temperatures and pressures above the critical point, the distinct liquid and gas phases do not exist. The substance is in a state known as a <strong>supercritical fluid</strong>. It can effuse through solids like a gas and dissolve materials like a liquid. It is a unique state of matter with properties that are intermediate between those of a liquid and a gas.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Phase Diagram</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">On a standard pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagram for a pure substance, the critical point is located at the top-right end of the vaporization curve (the line separating the liquid and gas phases).</p>\n",
