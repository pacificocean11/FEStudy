Allotropy</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Allotropy, or polymorphism, is the ability of a solid material to exist in more than one form or crystal structure. Pure iron is allotropic, and this property is the fundamental reason why steels can be heat treated.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Allotropes of Iron</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">As pure iron is heated and cooled, it changes its crystal structure at specific temperatures.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Ferrite (Alpha-iron, $\\alpha$-Fe):</strong> Exists from room temperature up to 912°C. It has a <strong>Body-Centered Cubic (BCC)</strong> crystal structure. This structure is relatively loosely packed, so it has a low solubility for carbon. Ferrite is soft, ductile, and magnetic.</li>\n    <li><strong>Austenite (Gamma-iron, $\\gamma$-Fe):</strong> Exists from 912°C to 1394°C. It has a <strong>Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)</strong> crystal structure. The FCC structure is more closely packed but has larger interstitial spaces, allowing it to dissolve much more carbon than ferrite (up to 2.11%). Austenite is non-magnetic and is the key phase from which most heat treatments begin.</li>\n    <li><strong>Delta-ferrite (Delta-iron, $\\delta$-Fe):</strong> Exists from 1394°C up to the melting point at 1538°C. It has a <strong>Body-Centered Cubic (BCC)</strong> structure, similar to alpha-ferrite. It is of limited practical importance in most steel treatments.</li>\n</ul>\n",
