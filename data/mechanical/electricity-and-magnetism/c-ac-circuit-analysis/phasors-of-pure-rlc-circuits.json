Phasors</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>phasor</strong> is a complex number that represents the amplitude and phase of a sinusoidal function. It's a graphical way to represent AC quantities that simplifies the analysis of circuits with inductors and capacitors.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A voltage $v(t) = V_p \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$ is represented by the phasor $V = V_{rms} \\angle \\phi$.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Phase Relationships</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In AC circuits, the voltage and current are not always in sync. The phase difference between them depends on the components in the circuit.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Resistor (R):</strong> The voltage across a resistor is exactly in phase with the current through it. The phase angle is 0°.</li>\n    \n    <li><strong>Inductor (L):</strong> The voltage across an inductor <strong>leads</strong> the current through it by 90°. This means the voltage peak occurs 90° (or a quarter cycle) before the current peak. A common mnemonic is <strong>ELI</strong>: in an inductor (L), voltage (E) comes before current (I).</li>\n\n    <li><strong>Capacitor (C):</strong> The current through a capacitor <strong>leads</strong> the voltage across it by 90°. This means the current peak occurs 90° before the voltage peak. A common mnemonic is <strong>ICE</strong>: in a capacitor (C), current (I) comes before voltage (E).</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "explanation": "For an inductor, the voltage must build up to drive the current against the inductor's opposition to change. This results in the voltage waveform leading the current waveform by 90°. This is remembered by the mnemonic 'ELI the ICE man'."
