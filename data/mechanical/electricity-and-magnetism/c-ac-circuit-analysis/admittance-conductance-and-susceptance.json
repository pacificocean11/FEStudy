It is a measure of how easily a circuit or component will allow current to flow. It is analogous to conductance in DC circuits.</p>\n$$ Y = \\frac{1}{Z} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The unit of admittance is the <strong>Siemens (S)</strong>, where $1 \\text{ S} = 1 \\; \u03A9^{-1}$.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Conductance (G) and Susceptance (B)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Since impedance is a complex number ($Z = R + jX$), admittance is also a complex number:</p>\n$$ Y = G + jB $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Conductance (G):</strong> The real part of admittance. It is <strong>not</strong> simply the reciprocal of resistance.</li>\n    <li><strong>Susceptance (B):</strong> The imaginary part of admittance. It is <strong>not</strong> simply the reciprocal of reactance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">To find G and B from R and X, you must perform complex division:</p>\n$$ Y = \\frac{1}{R+jX} = \\frac{1}{R+jX} \\cdot \\frac{R-jX}{R-jX} = \\frac{R - jX}{R^2 + X^2} = \\frac{R}{R^2+X^2} - j\\frac{X}{R^2+X^2} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Therefore, $G = \\frac{R}{R^2+X^2}$ and $B = -\\frac{X}{R^2+X^2}$.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Application</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">While impedance is useful for series circuits (where impedances add), admittance is very useful for parallel circuits. Just as conductances add in parallel in DC circuits, <strong>admittances add in parallel</strong> in AC circuits.</p>\n$$ Y_{total} = Y_1 + Y_2 + ... $$ \n",
