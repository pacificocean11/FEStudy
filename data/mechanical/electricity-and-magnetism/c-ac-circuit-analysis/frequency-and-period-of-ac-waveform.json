AC Waveforms</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Alternating Current (AC) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction, in contrast to Direct Current (DC) which flows only in one direction. The most common type of AC is the sinusoidal waveform, which can be described by the equation:</p>\n$$ v(t) = V_p \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi) $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$v(t)$ is the instantaneous voltage at time $t$.</li>\n    <li>$V_p$ is the peak voltage or amplitude.</li>\n    <li>$\\omega$ is the angular frequency.</li>\n    <li>$t$ is time.</li>\n    <li>$\\phi$ is the phase angle.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Period (T)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>period</strong> is the time it takes for one full cycle of the waveform. It is measured in seconds (s).</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Frequency (f)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>frequency</strong> is the number of cycles that occur in one second. It is the reciprocal of the period.</p>\n$$ f = \\frac{1}{T} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz), where $1 \\text{ Hz} = 1 \\text{ cycle/second}$.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Angular Frequency ($\\omega$)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>angular frequency</strong> (or angular velocity) describes the rate of change of the phase angle. It is related to the frequency by:</p>\n$$ \\omega = 2\\pi f = \\frac{2\\pi}{T} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Angular frequency is measured in radians per second (rad/s).</p>\n",
