It is a complex quantity that includes both resistance and reactance. Impedance is the AC equivalent of resistance in DC circuits.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Impedance is represented as a complex number: $Z = R + jX$, where R is resistance and X is reactance. Its unit is the Ohm (\u03A9).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Impedance of Passive Components</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The impedance of resistors, inductors, and capacitors depends on the frequency ($\\omega$) of the AC signal.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Resistor (R):</strong> Impedance is purely real and equal to its resistance. It is independent of frequency.</li>\n    $$Z_R = R$$\n    <li><strong>Inductor (L):</strong> Impedance is purely imaginary and is called inductive reactance ($X_L$). It increases with frequency.</li>\n    $$Z_L = j\\omega L = jX_L$$\n    <li><strong>Capacitor (C):</strong> Impedance is also purely imaginary and is called capacitive reactance ($X_C$). It decreases with frequency.</li>\n    $$Z_C = \\frac{1}{j\\omega C} = -\\frac{j}{\\omega C} = -jX_C$$\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Total Impedance in Series</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Impedances in series add together just like resistors in series. For a series RLC circuit:</p>\n$$Z_{total} = Z_R + Z_L + Z_C = R + j\\omega L - \\frac{j}{\\omega C} = R + j(X_L - X_C)$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The magnitude of the total impedance is found using the Pythagorean theorem:</p>\n$$|Z| = \\sqrt{R^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2}$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Ohm's Law for AC circuits is $V = IZ$, where V and I are RMS values.</p>\n",
