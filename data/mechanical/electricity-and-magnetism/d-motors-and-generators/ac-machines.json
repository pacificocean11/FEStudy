      "question": "A 4-pole induction motor operates on a 60 Hz power supply. What is the synchronous speed of the magnetic field?",

      "explanation": "Use the formula $n_s = 120f / P$. Here $f=60$ Hz and $P=4$. $n_s = (120 \\times 60) / 4 = 7200 / 4 = 1800$ rpm."

      "explanation": "Slip is calculated as $s = (n_s - n) / n_s$. With $n_s = 1800$ rpm and $n = 1710$ rpm: $s = (1800 - 1710) / 1800 = 90 / 1800 = 0.05$."
