It is a way to quantify the number of magnetic field lines penetrating a surface.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Formula</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For a uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ passing through a flat area $A$, the magnetic flux ($\\Phi_B$) is given by the dot product of the magnetic field vector and the area vector $\\mathbf{A}$ (where the direction of $\\mathbf{A}$ is normal, or perpendicular, to the surface):</p>\n$$\\Phi_B = \\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = BA \\cos(\\theta)$$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$\\Phi_B$ is the magnetic flux.</li>\n    <li>$B$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field.</li>\n    <li>$A$ is the area of the surface.</li>\n    <li>$\\theta$ is the angle between the magnetic field lines and the normal to the surface.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The flux is maximum when the field is perpendicular to the surface ($\u03b8 = 0^\circ$, $\\cos(0^\circ)=1$) and zero when the field is parallel to the surface ($\u03b8 = 90^\circ$, $\\cos(90^\circ)=0$).</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Unit of Magnetic Flux</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The SI unit of magnetic flux is the <strong>weber (Wb)</strong>, named after Wilhelm Eduard Weber. One weber is equivalent to one tesla-meter squared.</p>\n$$1 \\text{ Wb} = 1 \\text{ T} \\cdot \\text{m}^2$$\n",

Thus, $\\cos(\\theta) = 1$.\nUsing the formula $\\Phi_B = BA\\cos(\\theta)$: \n$\\Phi_B = (2.0 \\text{ T})(0.7854 \\text{ m}^2)(1) \\approx 1.57 \\text{ Wb}$."

      ],
      "explanation": "Magnetic flux is given by $\\Phi_B = BA\\cos(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the field and the *normal* to the loop. If the magnetic field is parallel to the plane of the loop, it is perpendicular (90\u00B0) to the normal line. Since $\\cos(90^\circ) = 0$, the magnetic flux is zero. If the area is zero, flux is also zero."
