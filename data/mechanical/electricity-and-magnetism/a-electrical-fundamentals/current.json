It is the amount of charge passing through a surface per unit of time. By convention, the direction of current is defined as the direction that positive charge would flow, even though in most metallic conductors it is the negatively charged electrons that are actually moving.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Formula</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Current ($I$) is the derivative of charge ($Q$) with respect to time ($t$):</p>\n$$I = \\frac{dQ}{dt}$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For a constant flow of charge, this simplifies to:</p>\n$$I = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}$$\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Unit of Current</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The SI unit of electric current is the <strong>ampere (A)</strong>, named after André-Marie Ampère. One ampere is defined as one coulomb of charge passing a point in one second.</p>\n$$1 \\text{ A} = 1 \\frac{\\text{C}}{\\text{s}}$$\n",
