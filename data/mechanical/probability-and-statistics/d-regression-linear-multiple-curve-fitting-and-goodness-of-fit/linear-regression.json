Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Linear regression</strong> is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable ($y$) and one or more independent variables ($x$) by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The most common form is simple linear regression, which involves a single independent variable.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The goal is to find the 'best-fit' straight line that describes the data. This line has the equation:</p>\n$$ y = mx + b $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$y$ is the dependent variable.</li>\n    <li>$x$ is the independent variable.</li>\n    <li>$m$ is the slope of the line.</li>\n    <li>$b$ is the y-intercept.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Method of Least Squares</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The 'best-fit' line is typically found using the <strong>method of least squares</strong>. This method finds the line that minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances (residuals) between the observed data points and the points on the fitted line.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Formulas for Slope and Intercept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For a set of $n$ data points $(x_i, y_i)$, the slope ($m$) and y-intercept ($b$) of the least-squares regression line are calculated as:</p>\n$$ m = \\frac{n(\\sum x_i y_i) - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{n(\\sum x_i^2) - (\\sum x_i)^2} $$\n$$ b = \\bar{y} - m\\bar{x} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">where $\\bar{y}$ is the mean of the y-values and $\\bar{x}$ is the mean of the x-values.</p>\n",

      "explanation": "We have n=3 points. First, calculate the necessary sums: $\\sum x = 1+2+3 = 6$. $\\sum y = 3+5+6 = 14$. $\\sum x^2 = 1^2+2^2+3^2 = 1+4+9 = 14$. $\\sum xy = (1)(3)+(2)(5)+(3)(6) = 3+10+18 = 31$. Now, use the slope formula: $m = \\frac{3(31) - (6)(14)}{3(14) - (6)^2} = \\frac{93 - 84}{42 - 36} = \\frac{9}{6} = 1.5$."

      "explanation": "From the previous problem, we know the slope $m=1.5$. We also need the means: $\\bar{x} = (\\sum x)/n = 6/3 = 2$. $\\bar{y} = (\\sum y)/n = 14/3 \\approx 4.67$. The y-intercept is $b = \\bar{y} - m\\bar{x} = 4.67 - (1.5)(2) = 4.67 - 3 = 1.67$."
