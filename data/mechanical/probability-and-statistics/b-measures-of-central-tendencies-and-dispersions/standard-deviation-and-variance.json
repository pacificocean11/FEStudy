The most common measures are variance and standard deviation.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Variance ($s^2$)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>sample variance</strong> is the average of the squared differences from the mean. A larger variance indicates that the data points are more spread out.</p>\n$$ s^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Note the use of $n-1$ in the denominator for a sample variance. This is known as Bessel's correction and provides an unbiased estimate of the population variance.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Standard Deviation (s)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>sample standard deviation</strong> is the square root of the variance. It is a more intuitive measure of spread because it is in the same units as the original data.</p>\n$$ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean, whereas a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.</p>\n",

      "explanation": "First, find the mean: $\\bar{x} = (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 3$. Next, find the sum of squared differences: $(1-3)^2 + (2-3)^2 + (3-3)^2 + (4-3)^2 + (5-3)^2 = (-2)^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 4+1+0+1+4 = 10$. Finally, divide by $n-1 = 5-1=4$. Variance $s^2 = 10 / 4 = 2.5$."
