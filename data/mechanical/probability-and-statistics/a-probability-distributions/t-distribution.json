  "notes": "\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">1. When to Use the t-Distribution</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The t-distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is used in statistical inference, particularly when:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>The sample size is small (typically $n < 30$).</li>\n    <li>The population standard deviation ($\u03c3$) is unknown and must be estimated from the sample standard deviation ($s$).</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">If the population standard deviation is known or the sample size is large, the normal (Z) distribution is typically used instead.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Properties of the t-Distribution</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>It is symmetric and bell-shaped, similar to the normal distribution, and centered at 0.</li>\n    <li>It has \"heavier\" tails than the normal distribution, meaning it has more probability in the tails. This reflects the added uncertainty from estimating the population standard deviation.</li>\n    <li>The shape of the t-distribution depends on a parameter called <strong>degrees of freedom (df)</strong>. For problems involving a sample mean, $df = n - 1$, where $n$ is the sample size.</li>\n    <li>As the degrees of freedom increase (i.e., as the sample size gets larger), the t-distribution gets closer in shape to the standard normal distribution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Using the t-Distribution</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The t-distribution is primarily used for constructing confidence intervals and for hypothesis testing about a population mean.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The formula for the <strong>t-statistic</strong> is analogous to the z-score, but uses the sample standard deviation:</p>\n$$t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}}$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">where $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $\\mu$ is the population mean, $s$ is the sample standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size.</p>\n    ",

      "explanation": "The primary conditions for using the t-distribution are a small sample size (usually n < 30) and an unknown population standard deviation, which must be estimated using the sample standard deviation."

      ],
      "explanation": "As the sample size (and thus degrees of freedom) increases, the sample standard deviation ($s$) becomes a more reliable estimate of the population standard deviation ($\u03c3$). Consequently, the t-distribution converges in shape to the standard normal (Z) distribution."

Looking up $df=10$ and a cumulative probability of $1-0.025=0.975$ (or a two-tailed $\\alpha$ of 0.05) in a t-table gives a critical value of 2.228."
