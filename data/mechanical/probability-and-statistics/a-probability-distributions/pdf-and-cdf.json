There are two types:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Discrete Random Variable:</strong> Can take on a countable number of distinct values (e.g., the outcome of a dice roll, the number of defects in a sample).</li>\n    <li><strong>Continuous Random Variable:</strong> Can take on any value within a given range (e.g., the height of a person, the temperature of a room).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Probability Mass Function (PMF)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For a discrete random variable X, the Probability Mass Function (PMF), denoted $p(x)$, gives the probability that X is exactly equal to some value x.</p>\n$$p(x) = P(X = x)$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A valid PMF must satisfy two conditions: $p(x) \\ge 0$ for all x, and $\\sum p(x) = 1$ (the sum of all probabilities is 1).</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Probability Density Function (PDF)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For a continuous random variable X, the Probability Density Function (PDF), denoted $f(x)$, is a function where the area under the curve between two points represents the probability that the variable falls within that range.</p>\n$$P(a \\le X \\le b) = \\int_a^b f(x)dx$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A valid PDF must satisfy two conditions: $f(x) \\ge 0$ for all x, and $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)dx = 1$ (the total area under the curve is 1). Note that for any single point c, $P(X=c)=0$.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), denoted $F(x)$, gives the probability that the random variable X is less than or equal to a value x.</p>\n$$F(x) = P(X \\le x)$$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>For a discrete variable: $F(x) = \\sum_{t \\le x} p(t)$</li>\n    <li>For a continuous variable: $F(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} f(t)dt$</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The CDF is non-decreasing and ranges from 0 to 1. The probability of an interval can be found using the CDF: $P(a < X \\le b) = F(b) - F(a)$.</p>\n    ",
