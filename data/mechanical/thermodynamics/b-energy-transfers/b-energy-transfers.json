Energy Transfer by Heat ($Q$)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Heat is energy transferred between a system and its surroundings due to a temperature difference. It always flows from higher to lower temperature.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Adiabatic Process:</strong> A process with zero heat transfer ($Q=0$).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Energy Transfer by Work ($W$)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Work is energy transfer associated with a force acting through a distance. In thermodynamics, work is energy transfer across the system boundary that is <em>not</em> caused by a temperature difference.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Boundary Work ($W_b$):</strong> Work done by the expansion or compression of a fluid (moving boundary). $W_b = \\int P dV$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Shaft Work ($W_{sh}$):</strong> Energy transmitted by a rotating shaft (e.g., in a turbine or compressor). Power $\\dot{W}_{sh} = 2\\pi \\dot{n} T$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Electrical Work ($W_e$):</strong> Energy transferred by electrons crossing the system boundary. $\\dot{W}_e = VI$.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Flow Work</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In open systems (control volumes), energy is required to push mass into or out of the control volume. This is called flow work or flow energy.</p>\n$$ W_{flow} = PV $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This term is combined with internal energy ($U$) to define enthalpy ($H = U + PV$), which simplifies the analysis of open systems.</p>\n",
