It is the basis for the concept of temperature.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The law states:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"border-l-4 border-slate-300 pl-4 italic my-4\">\n    If two thermodynamic systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third one, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Explanation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Imagine you have three objects: A, B, and C.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>If you touch object A to object C and no heat flows between them, they are in thermal equilibrium.</li>\n    <li>If you touch object B to object C and no heat flows between them, they are also in thermal equilibrium.</li>\n    <li>The Zeroth Law then tells us that if you touch object A to object B, no heat will flow between them either. They are already in thermal equilibrium with each other.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Basis for Temperature</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This law is fundamental because it implies the existence of a property called <strong>temperature</strong>. If two objects are in thermal equilibrium, they have the same temperature. Object C in the example above can be thought of as a thermometer. By showing that A and B are both at the same temperature as C, we know that A and B are at the same temperature as each other without ever having to bring them into contact.</p>\n",

      "explanation": "This is a direct statement of the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics. If X and Y have the same temperature, and Y and Z have the same temperature, then X and Z must also have the same temperature, meaning they are in thermal equilibrium."
