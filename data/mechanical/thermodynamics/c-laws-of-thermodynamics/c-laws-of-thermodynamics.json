The Four Laws</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Zeroth Law:</strong> If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This defines <strong>temperature</strong>.</li>\n    <li><strong>First Law:</strong> Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only change forms. This defines <strong>internal energy ($U$)</strong>. For a cycle, net heat equals net work.</li>\n    <li><strong>Second Law:</strong> Processes occur in a certain direction. Energy has quality as well as quantity. It establishes the limits on the efficiency of heat engines and refrigerators. This defines <strong>entropy ($S$)</strong>.</li>\n    <li><strong>Third Law:</strong> The entropy of a pure crystalline substance at absolute zero temperature is zero. This establishes a base for calculating absolute entropy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. First Law Equations</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Closed System:</strong> $\\Delta U = Q - W$</li>\n    <li><strong>Open System (Steady Flow):</strong> $\\dot{Q} - \\dot{W} = \\dot{m} \\Delta (h + v^2/2 + gz)$</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Second Law Principles</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The Second Law dictates that heat cannot spontaneously flow from a cold body to a hot body (Clausius Statement) and that no heat engine can be 100% efficient (Kelvin-Planck Statement). The maximum possible efficiency is the Carnot efficiency: $\\eta_{max} = 1 - T_L/T_H$.</p>\n",

      "question": "A heat engine absorbs 500 J of heat from a source and rejects 300 J of heat to a sink. Which law dictates that the efficiency is less than 100%?",

        { "text": "First Law", "isCorrect": false },

        { "text": "Zeroth Law", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The Second Law (specifically the Kelvin-Planck statement) states that it is impossible to build a heat engine that operates in a cycle and produces no other effect than the production of work and the transfer of heat from a single body. Some heat must be rejected, so efficiency is always < 100%."
