Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The Otto cycle is the idealized thermodynamic cycle that describes the functioning of a typical spark-ignition reciprocating piston engine (i.e., most gasoline car engines).</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. The Four Processes</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The ideal Otto cycle consists of four internally reversible processes:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Process 1-2 (Isentropic Compression):</strong> The piston moves from bottom dead center (BDC) to top dead center (TDC), compressing the air-fuel mixture.</li>\n    <li><strong>Process 2-3 (Constant-Volume Heat Addition):</strong> The mixture is ignited by a spark plug, causing a rapid increase in temperature and pressure while the volume is essentially constant (at TDC). This represents combustion.</li>\n    <li><strong>Process 3-4 (Isentropic Expansion):</strong> The high pressure from combustion pushes the piston from TDC to BDC, producing the power stroke.</li>\n    <li><strong>Process 4-1 (Constant-Volume Heat Rejection):</strong> The exhaust valve opens, and heat is rejected from the cylinder at constant volume as the pressure drops to the initial state.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Thermal Efficiency</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The thermal efficiency of an ideal Otto cycle depends on the compression ratio ($r$) and the specific heat ratio ($k = c_p/c_v$) of the working fluid.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The compression ratio is $r = V_1/V_2 = V_{max}/V_{min}$.</p>\n$$\\eta_{th, Otto} = 1 - \\frac{1}{r^{k-1}}$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This formula shows that increasing the compression ratio increases the efficiency of the Otto cycle.</p>\n",
