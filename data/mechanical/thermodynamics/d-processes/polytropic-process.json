Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A polytropic process is a generalized thermodynamic process that follows the relation:</p>\n$$PV^n = \\text{constant}$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">where $n$ is the polytropic index, which can be any real number. This single equation can be used to describe a wide range of processes by changing the value of $n$.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Special Cases</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The polytropic process includes other common processes as special cases:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$n = 0$: $PV^0 = P = \\text{constant}$ (<strong>Isobaric</strong> process)</li>\n    <li>$n = 1$: $PV^1 = PV = \\text{constant}$ (<strong>Isothermal</strong> process for an ideal gas)</li>\n    <li>$n = k$: $PV^k = \\text{constant}$ (<strong>Adiabatic</strong> process for an ideal gas, where $k=c_p/c_v$)</li>\n    <li>$n \\to \\infty$: (<strong>Isochoric</strong> process)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Work Done</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The work done during a polytropic process is given by:</p>\n$$W = \\frac{P_2V_2 - P_1V_1}{1-n} \\quad \\text{(for } n \\neq 1\\text{)}$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For the case where $n=1$ (isothermal), the work formula is $W = P_1V_1 \\ln(V_2/V_1)$.</p>\n",
