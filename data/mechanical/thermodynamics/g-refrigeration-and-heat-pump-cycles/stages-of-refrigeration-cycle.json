It is a closed cycle involving a working fluid (a refrigerant) that undergoes phase changes to move heat from a cold space to a warm space.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. The Four Main Stages/Components</h3>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Evaporator (Heat Absorption):</strong> Low-pressure liquid/vapor mixture refrigerant enters the evaporator. It absorbs heat from the cold space (the space being refrigerated), causing the refrigerant to boil and turn into a low-pressure saturated vapor. This is the desired cooling effect, $Q_L$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Compressor (Work Input):</strong> The low-pressure vapor is drawn into a compressor, which does work on the refrigerant to compress it to a high-pressure, high-temperature superheated vapor. This requires work input, $W_{in}$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Condenser (Heat Rejection):</strong> The high-pressure, hot vapor flows into the condenser. Here, it rejects heat ($Q_H$) to the warmer surroundings (e.g., the air behind the fridge), causing the refrigerant to cool down and condense into a high-pressure saturated liquid.</li>\n    <li><strong>Expansion Valve (Throttling):</strong> The high-pressure liquid passes through an expansion valve (a throttling device), which causes a large pressure drop. This is an isenthalpic process (constant enthalpy). The refrigerant emerges as a low-pressure, low-temperature liquid/vapor mixture, ready to enter the evaporator again.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Coefficient of Performance (COP)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The efficiency of a refrigeration or heat pump cycle is measured by its Coefficient of Performance (COP), which is the ratio of the desired output to the required input.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>For a Refrigerator:</strong> The desired output is the heat removed from the cold space ($Q_L$).</li>\n    $$ COP_R = \\frac{\\text{Desired Output}}{\\text{Required Input}} = \\frac{Q_L}{W_{in}} $$\n    <li><strong>For a Heat Pump:</strong> The desired output is the heat delivered to the hot space ($Q_H$).</li>\n    $$ COP_{HP} = \\frac{\\text{Desired Output}}{\\text{Required Input}} = \\frac{Q_H}{W_{in}} $$\n    <p>By the first law, $W_{in} = Q_H - Q_L$, so there is a direct relationship between the two COPs: $COP_{HP} = COP_R + 1$.</p>\n</ul>\n",

      "explanation": "The evaporator is the component located inside the cold space. The refrigerant boils (evaporates) at a low temperature, absorbing heat from its surroundings and thus producing the cooling effect."

      "explanation": "The COP of a refrigerator is the desired output (heat removed, $Q_L$) divided by the required input (work, $W_{in}$). $COP_R = Q_L / W_{in} = 300 \\text{ kJ} / 100 \\text{ kJ} = 3.0$."
