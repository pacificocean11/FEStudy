Dalton's Law</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures</strong> states that the total pressure exerted by a mixture of non-reacting gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases.</p>\n$$ P_{mixture} = \\sum P_i = P_A + P_B + P_C + ... $$\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Partial Pressure ($P_i$)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>partial pressure</strong> of a gas in a mixture is the pressure that the gas would exert if it occupied the entire volume of the mixture by itself, at the same temperature.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For an ideal gas mixture, the partial pressure of a component is directly proportional to its mole fraction ($y_i$).</p>\n$$ P_i = y_i P_{mixture} $$\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Amagat's Law of Partial Volumes</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A related law is <strong>Amagat's Law</strong>, which states that the total volume of a gas mixture is equal to the sum of the partial volumes of the individual component gases.</p>\n$$ V_{mixture} = \\sum V_i $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The partial volume ($V_i$) is the volume that a component would occupy if it were at the mixture's temperature and total pressure.

      ],
      "explanation": "The mole fraction of oxygen is $y_{O2} = 0.20$. The partial pressure is the mole fraction times the total pressure: $P_{O2} = y_{O2} P_{total} = 0.20 \\times 200 \\text{ kPa} = 40$ kPa."

      "question": "A tank contains 1 mole of helium and 3 moles of argon at a total pressure of 4 atm. What is the partial pressure of the argon?",

      "explanation": "First, find the mole fraction of argon. The total number of moles is $N_m = 1 + 3 = 4$ moles. The mole fraction of argon is $y_{Ar} = N_{Ar} / N_m = 3 / 4 = 0.75$. The partial pressure is $P_{Ar} = y_{Ar} P_{total} = 0.75 \\times 4 \\text{ atm} = 3$ atm."
