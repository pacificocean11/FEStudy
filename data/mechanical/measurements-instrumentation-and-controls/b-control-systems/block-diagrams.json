Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>block diagram</strong> is a graphical representation of a system in which the principal parts or functions are represented by blocks connected by lines that show the relationships between the blocks. In control systems, they are used to visualize the flow of signals and the functional relationships between components.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Basic Elements</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Blocks:</strong> Rectangles that represent the transfer function ($G(s)$) of a system or component. The output signal is the input signal multiplied by the transfer function.</li>\n    <li><strong>Signals:</strong> Lines with arrows that represent the flow of signals (e.g., voltage, position, error).</li>\n    <li><strong>Summing Junctions:</strong> Circles used to show the addition or subtraction of signals.</li>\n    <li><strong>Takeoff (or Pickoff) Points:</strong> Points from which a signal is taken and fed to another block or summing junction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Standard Feedback Loop</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The most common configuration is the canonical negative feedback loop. It has a forward path transfer function $G(s)$ and a feedback path transfer function $H(s)$. The overall closed-loop transfer function, which relates the output $Y(s)$ to the input $R(s)$, is:</p>\n$$ \\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \\frac{G(s)}{1 + G(s)H(s)} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For positive feedback, the sign in the denominator becomes negative.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Block Diagram Algebra</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Complex block diagrams can be simplified using a set of rules:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Blocks in Cascade (Series):</strong> The equivalent transfer function is the product of the individual transfer functions. $G_{eq} = G_1 G_2$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Blocks in Parallel:</strong> The equivalent transfer function is the sum of the individual transfer functions. $G_{eq} = G_1 + G_2$.</li>\n</ul>\n",
