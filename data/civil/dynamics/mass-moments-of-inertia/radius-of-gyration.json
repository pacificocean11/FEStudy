Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>mass radius of gyration ($k$)</strong> is a geometric property that provides a measure of how the mass of a body is distributed about a specific axis of rotation. It can be imagined as the radial distance from the axis at which the entire mass of the body could be concentrated into a thin ring and still have the same moment of inertia.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The radius of gyration is defined by rearranging the moment of inertia formula. For a body with mass $m$ and moment of inertia $I$ about a given axis, the radius of gyration $k$ about that same axis is:</p>\n$$ I = mk^2 \\quad \\implies \\quad k = \\sqrt{\\frac{I}{m}} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The radius of gyration has units of length (e.g., meters or feet).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Application</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The radius of gyration is a convenient way to represent the moment of inertia of a complex shape. It is used in various dynamic analyses, particularly in the study of vibrations and column buckling (though buckling uses the area radius of gyration, the concept is similar).</p>\n",
