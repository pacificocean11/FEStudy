Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>Parallel Axis Theorem</strong> is a fundamental principle used to determine the mass moment of inertia of a rigid body about any axis, given the moment of inertia about a parallel axis that passes through the body's center of mass (G).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. The Theorem</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The moment of inertia ($I$) about any axis is equal to the moment of inertia about a parallel centroidal axis ($I_G$), plus the product of the body's total mass ($m$) and the square of the perpendicular distance ($d$) between the two axes.</p>\n$$ I = I_G + md^2 $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This theorem is essential for two main reasons:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>It allows us to find the moment of inertia for an object rotating about a point other than its center of mass (e.g., a rod rotating about its end).</li>\n    <li>It is used to calculate the moment of inertia of composite bodies by summing the moments of inertia of their individual parts about a common axis.</li>\n</ul>\n",
