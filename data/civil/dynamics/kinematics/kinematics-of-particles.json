Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Kinematics</strong> is the branch of mechanics that describes the motion of objects without considering the forces that cause the motion. When the object is small enough to be modeled as a single point, we analyze the <strong>kinematics of a particle</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Rectilinear Motion</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This describes motion along a straight line. The key relationships are based on calculus:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>Velocity is the time derivative of position: $v = ds/dt$</li>\n    <li>Acceleration is the time derivative of velocity: $a = dv/dt = d^2s/dt^2$</li>\n    <li>A third useful relation is derived from the first two: $a \\ ds = v \\ dv$</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Constant Acceleration:</strong> If acceleration is constant, these relationships integrate to the well-known kinematic equations:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$v = v_0 + at$</li>\n    <li>$s = s_0 + v_0t + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$</li>\n    <li>$v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(s - s_0)$</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Curvilinear Motion (Projectile Motion)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For motion along a curved path in 2D, we analyze the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components of motion independently. For projectile motion (ignoring air resistance):</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Horizontal Motion:</strong> Constant velocity ($a_x = 0$).</li>\n    <li><strong>Vertical Motion:</strong> Constant downward acceleration ($a_y = -g$).</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The constant acceleration equations are applied separately to each direction.</p>\n",
