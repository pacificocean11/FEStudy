Probability Distributions</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of obtaining the possible values that a random variable can take.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Discrete Distributions:</strong> The variable can only take on a countable number of values (e.g., Binomial, Poisson).</li>\n    <li><strong>Continuous Distributions:</strong> The variable can take on any value within a given range (e.g., Normal, Uniform).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Normal Distribution</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The normal distribution is a continuous, symmetric, bell-shaped distribution defined by its mean ($\u03bc$) and standard deviation ($\u03c3$). It is the most important distribution in statistics. The <strong>standard normal distribution</strong> has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Any normal variable X can be transformed into a standard normal variable Z using the z-score:</p>\n$$ z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} $$\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Binomial Distribution</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The binomial distribution models the number of 'successes' in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two outcomes (success or failure) and the probability of success ($p$) is constant. The probability of getting exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials is:</p>\n$$ P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\n",

      "explanation": "Use the z-score formula: $z = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3 = (650 - 500) / 100 = 150 / 100 = 1.5$."
