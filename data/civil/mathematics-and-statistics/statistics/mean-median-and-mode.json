Measures of Central Tendency</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Measures of central tendency are single values that attempt to describe a set of data by identifying the central position within that set of data. The three main measures are the mean, median, and mode.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Mean (Average)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values. It is the most common measure of central tendency.</p>\n$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} $$\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Median</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The median is the middle value in a dataset that has been arranged in order of magnitude. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Mode</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode, more than one mode (multimodal), or no mode at all.</p>\n",
