Definition of a Parabola</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A parabola is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point (the focus) and a fixed line (the directrix).</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Standard Form Equations</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The standard form of the equation of a parabola with vertex $(h, k)$ depends on its orientation:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Opens Vertically (Up or Down):</strong> $$(x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)$$\n        <ul class=\"list-circle list-inside ml-6\">\n            <li>If $p > 0$, the parabola opens upward.</li>\n            <li>If $p < 0$, the parabola opens downward.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Opens Horizontally (Left or Right):</strong> $$(y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h)$$\n        <ul class=\"list-circle list-inside ml-6\">\n            <li>If $p > 0$, the parabola opens to the right.</li>\n            <li>If $p < 0$, the parabola opens to the left.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Key Properties</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Vertex:</strong> The point $(h, k)$, which is the turning point of the parabola.</li>\n    <li><strong>Axis of Symmetry:</strong> The line that passes through the vertex and focus, dividing the parabola into two symmetric halves. For a vertical parabola, it is $x=h$. For a horizontal parabola, it is $y=k$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> A point located a distance of $|p|$ from the vertex along the axis of symmetry, inside the parabola.</li>\n    <li><strong>Directrix:</strong> A line located a distance of $|p|$ from the vertex on the other side from the focus.

      "explanation": "The standard form for a vertical parabola is $(x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)$. Comparing this to the given equation, we have $h=3$ and $k=-1$. The vertex is $(h, k) = (3, -1)$."

      "explanation": "The equation is of the form $(y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h)$, which is a horizontal parabola. Here, $4p = -8$, which means $p = -2$. Since $p$ is negative, the parabola opens to the left."

      "explanation": "The equation is in the form $x^2 = 4py$, which is a simplified version of $(x-0)^2 = 4p(y-0)$. The vertex is at the origin $(0,0)$. We have $4p = 16$, so $p=4$. Since the parabola is of the $x^2$ form, it opens vertically. Because $p>0$, it opens upward. The focus is located a distance $p$ from the vertex along the axis of symmetry (the y-axis). Therefore, the focus is at $(0, 0+p)$, which is $(0, 4)$."

The focus is $p$ units to the right of the vertex, and the directrix is a vertical line $p$ units to the left of the vertex. The vertex x-coordinate is -4. The directrix is at $x = h - p = -4 - 5 = -9$."

      ],
      "explanation": "The vertex is $(h,k) = (2,3)$. The focus is at $(2,5)$. Since the x-coordinates are the same, the parabola opens vertically. The focus is above the vertex, so it opens upward, and $p$ will be positive. The distance from the vertex to the focus is $p = 5 - 3 = 2$. The standard equation for a vertical parabola is $(x-h)^2 = 4p(y-k)$. Plugging in the values, we get $(x-2)^2 = 4(2)(y-3)$, which simplifies to $(x-2)^2 = 8(y-3)$."
