Depending on the angle of the plane relative to the cone, four types of curves can be created: circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7sYa7L7.png\" alt=\"Conic Sections Diagram\" class=\"mx-auto my-4 rounded-lg bg-white\">\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. General Equation of a Conic Section</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Every conic section can be described by a second-degree equation in two variables:</p>\n$$Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">where A, B, C, D, E, and F are constants. The term $Bxy$ represents a rotation of the conic. For the FE exam, you will typically deal with conics aligned with the coordinate axes, meaning $B=0$.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. The Discriminant</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">When $B=0$, the type of conic can be identified by looking at the coefficients A and C.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>If $A = C$ (and not zero), the conic is a <strong>Circle</strong>.</li>\n    <li>If $A \\cdot C > 0$ and $A \\neq C$, the conic is an <strong>Ellipse</strong>.</li>\n    <li>If $A \\cdot C = 0$ (i.e., either A or C is zero, but not both), the conic is a <strong>Parabola</strong>.</li>\n    <li>If $A \\cdot C < 0$ (i.e., A and C have opposite signs), the conic is a <strong>Hyperbola</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">If the $Bxy$ term is present, a value called the discriminant ($B^2 - 4AC$) is used:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>If $B^2 - 4AC < 0$, it is an Ellipse (or a circle if B=0 and A=C).</li>\n    <li>If $B^2 - 4AC = 0$, it is a Parabola.</li>\n    <li>If $B^2 - 4AC > 0$, it is a Hyperbola.</li>\n</ul>\n                ",
