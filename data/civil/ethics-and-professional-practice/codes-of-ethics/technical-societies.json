Role of Professional Societies</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Professional and technical societies, such as the <strong>American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)</strong> or the <strong>National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE)</strong>, play a crucial role in the engineering profession. They establish their own codes of ethics, which, while not always legally binding like state licensure laws (unless adopted by the state), set the standard for professional conduct for their members.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Common Fundamental Canons</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The codes of ethics from various societies are very similar and are typically based on the same core principles found in the NCEES Model Rules. The fundamental canons usually include:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.</li>\n    <li>Engineers shall perform services only in areas of their competence.</li>\n    <li>Engineers shall issue public statements in an objective and truthful manner.</li>\n    <li>Engineers shall act for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees.</li>\n    <li>Engineers shall avoid deceptive acts.</li>\n    <li>Engineers shall conduct themselves honorably, responsibly, ethically, and lawfully so as to enhance the honor, reputation, and usefulness of the profession.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Professional Development</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Many society codes also explicitly state that engineers have a duty to continue their professional development throughout their careers and should encourage the professional development of the engineers under their supervision. This commitment to lifelong learning is essential for maintaining competence.</p>\n",

        { "text": "Only the laws of the state where they practice.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "The NCEES Model Rules only.", "isCorrect": false },

        { "text": "No code of ethics, only their personal judgment.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "While licensed engineers are legally bound by their state's laws and rules, membership in a professional society like ASCE carries the additional obligation to adhere to that society's specific code of ethics. These codes often set a high standard for professional conduct."
