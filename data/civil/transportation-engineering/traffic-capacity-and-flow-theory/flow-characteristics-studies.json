Traffic Flow Parameters</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Traffic flow is described by three fundamental macroscopic parameters:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Flow Rate ($q$):</strong> Also called Volume. The number of vehicles passing a point per unit time (usually vehicles per hour, vph).</li>\n    <li><strong>Speed ($u$):</strong> The distance traveled per unit time. <strong>Space Mean Speed ($u_s$)</strong> is the harmonic mean of individual vehicle speeds and is used in flow theory relationships.</li>\n    <li><strong>Density ($k$):</strong> The number of vehicles occupying a given length of roadway (usually vehicles per mile, vpm, or vehicles per km).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. The Fundamental Relationship</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">These three parameters are related by the fundamental equation of traffic flow:</p>\n$$ q = k \\cdot u_s $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Flow Rate = Density $\\times$ Space Mean Speed</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Greenshields Model</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The simplest model relating speed and density is the Greenshields model, which assumes a linear relationship:</p>\n$$ u_s = u_f \\left( 1 - \\frac{k}{k_j} \\right) $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$u_f$: <strong>Free-flow speed</strong> (speed when density is zero).</li>\n    <li>$k_j$: <strong>Jam density</strong> (density when speed is zero, i.e., traffic is stopped).</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Substituting this into the fundamental equation gives a parabolic relationship between flow and density:</p>\n$$ q = u_f k - \\frac{u_f}{k_j} k^2 $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Maximum flow (Capacity, $q_{max}$) occurs at optimal density ($k_{opt} = k_j/2$) and optimal speed ($u_{opt} = u_f/2$).</p>\n$$ q_{max} = \\frac{u_f k_j}{4} $$\n",

        { "text": "2400 vph", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Using the formula derived from the Greenshields model: $q_{max} = (u_f \\cdot k_j) / 4 = (60 \\cdot 120) / 4 = 7200 / 4 = 1800$ vehicles per hour."
