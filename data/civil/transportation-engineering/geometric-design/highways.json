Horizontal Alignment</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The horizontal alignment consists of straight sections (tangents) connected by circular curves.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Superelevation ($e$):</strong> On horizontal curves, the roadway is banked (tilted) to counteract the centrifugal force that pushes a vehicle outward. This banking is called superelevation. The relationship between speed ($V$), radius ($R$), superelevation ($e$), and side friction factor ($f_s$) is:</li>\n    $$ R_{min} = \\frac{V^2}{g(e + f_s)} $$\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Vertical Alignment</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The vertical alignment consists of constant-grade sections (tangents) connected by vertical curves, which are parabolic.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Crest Vertical Curves:</strong> Curves that have a convex shape (like the top of a hill). Design is governed by providing adequate stopping sight distance.</li>\n    <li><strong>Sag Vertical Curves:</strong> Curves that have a concave shape (like the bottom of a valley). Design is governed by headlight sight distance at night, as well as rider comfort and drainage.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Stopping Sight Distance (SSD)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">SSD is the minimum distance required for a driver traveling at the design speed to see an object on the road, react, and bring the vehicle to a complete stop before hitting the object. It is the sum of two components:</p>\n<p class=\"text-center font-semibold mb-4\">SSD = Brake Reaction Distance + Braking Distance</p>\n$$ SSD = V t_r + \\frac{V^2}{2g(a/g \\pm G)} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$V$: Design speed.</li>\n    <li>$t_r$: Brake reaction time (typically 2.5 seconds).</li>\n    <li>$a$: Deceleration rate.</li>\n    <li>$G$: Grade of the roadway (as a decimal).</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "explanation": "Superelevation, or banking, tilts the roadway to help vehicles navigate a curve. A component of the car's weight helps resist the centrifugal force that is pushing the car to the outside of the curve, reducing the reliance on side friction from the tires."
