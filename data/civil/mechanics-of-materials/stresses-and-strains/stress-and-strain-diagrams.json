The Tensile Test</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>stress-strain diagram</strong> is a fundamental plot in mechanics of materials, generated from data obtained in a tensile test. A specimen of a material is pulled apart, and the applied load (stress) and the elongation (strain) are recorded. The resulting curve reveals many of the material's important mechanical properties.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Key Regions and Points for Steel</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Elastic Region:</strong> The initial linear portion of the curve. If the load is removed in this region, the material will return to its original shape. The slope of this line is the <strong>Modulus of Elasticity (E)</strong>, or Young's Modulus.</li>\n    <li><strong>Yield Point:</strong> The point at which the material begins to deform plastically (permanently). The stress at this point is the <strong>Yield Strength ($F_y$)</strong>.</li>\n    <li><strong>Strain Hardening:</strong> After yielding, the material becomes stronger and more stress is required to continue the deformation.</li>\n    <li><strong>Ultimate Tensile Strength ($F_u$):</strong> The maximum stress the material can withstand. It is the peak of the stress-strain curve.</li>\n    <li><strong>Fracture:</strong> The point at which the specimen breaks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Ductility</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Ductility</strong> is the amount of plastic deformation a material can undergo before fracture. It is measured by the percent elongation at fracture. Ductile materials, like steel, provide a warning of failure by deforming visibly. Brittle materials, like concrete in tension, fail suddenly.</p>\n",
