Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Axial stress</strong> is the stress in a member that is subjected to an axial force (a force acting along its longitudinal axis). The stress is assumed to be uniform across the member's cross-section.</p>\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{P}{A} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$\\sigma$: Normal stress.</li>\n    <li>$P$: Applied axial load (tension or compression).</li>\n    <li>$A$: Cross-sectional area of the member.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A positive result indicates tensile stress, while a negative result indicates compressive stress.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Axial Strain and Hooke's Law</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Strain ($\\epsilon$)</strong> is the measure of deformation, defined as the change in length divided by the original length.</p>\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\delta}{L} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Within the elastic region, stress is directly proportional to strain. This relationship is <strong>Hooke's Law</strong>.</p>\n$$ \\sigma = E\\epsilon $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Where $E$ is the Modulus of Elasticity, a measure of the material's stiffness.</p>\n",
