Thermal Expansion</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Most materials expand when their temperature increases and contract when their temperature decreases. If a member is unrestrained (free to move), a change in temperature will cause it to change in length. This change in length is the thermal deformation, $\\delta_T$.</p>\n$$ \\delta_T = \\alpha L \\Delta T $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$\\delta_T$: Change in length due to temperature.</li>\n    <li>$\\alpha$: Coefficient of thermal expansion, a material property.</li>\n    <li>$L$: Original length of the member.</li>\n    <li>$\\Delta T$: Change in temperature.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Thermal Stress</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">If a member is restrained so that it cannot expand or contract freely, a change in temperature will induce an internal stress, known as <strong>thermal stress</strong>. This is a statically indeterminate problem.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">To find the thermal stress, we can imagine the process in two steps:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>Imagine the member is unrestrained and let it deform by $\\delta_T = \\alpha L \\Delta T$.</li>\n    <li>Calculate the force, P, that would be required to push the member back to its original restrained length. This deformation is $\\delta_P = PL/AE$.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Since the net deformation is zero, $\\delta_T + \\delta_P = 0$.</p>\n$$ \\alpha L \\Delta T + \\frac{PL}{AE} = 0 $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The force is compressive, so $P = -\\alpha A E \\Delta T$. The thermal stress is $\\sigma = P/A$:</p>\n$$ \\sigma_T = - E \\alpha \\Delta T $$\n",
