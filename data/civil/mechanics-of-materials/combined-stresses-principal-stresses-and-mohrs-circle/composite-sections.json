Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>composite section</strong> is a structural member composed of two or more different materials that are bonded together to act as a single unit. Common examples include reinforced concrete beams (concrete and steel) or flitched beams (wood and steel plates).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Transformed Section Method</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">To analyze the stresses in a composite section, the <strong>transformed section method</strong> is used. This method involves creating an equivalent, imaginary cross-section made of a single material that has the same properties as the composite section.</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>Choose one of the materials as the base material (usually the softer one).</li>\n    <li>Calculate the <strong>modular ratio ($n$)</strong>, which is the ratio of the moduli of elasticity of the two materials.</li>\n    $$ n = \\frac{E_{stiffer}}{E_{softer}} $$\n    <li>Create the transformed section by replacing the stiffer material with an equivalent area of the softer material. The width of the stiffer material is multiplied by the modular ratio, while its height remains the same.</li>\n    <li>Analyze the transformed section as if it were a normal, homogeneous member to find its centroid and moment of inertia.</li>\n    <li>Calculate the stress in the transformed section using the standard flexure formula, $\\sigma = My/I$.</li>\n    <li>To find the actual stress in the stiffer material, multiply the stress calculated in the transformed section by the modular ratio: $\\sigma_{stiffer} = n \\cdot \\sigma_{transformed}$.</li>\n</ol>\n",

      "explanation": "To transform the stiffer material (steel) into the softer material (wood), you multiply its width by the modular ratio, n. This creates a wider, imaginary wood section that has the same stiffness as the original steel plate."
