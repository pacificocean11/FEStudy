Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>Radius of Gyration ($k$)</strong> is a geometric property of a cross-section that provides a measure of how the area is distributed about a given axis. It can be imagined as the distance from the axis at which the entire area could be concentrated into a thin strip and still have the same moment of inertia.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The radius of gyration is defined as the square root of the moment of inertia ($I$) divided by the total area ($A$).</p>\n$$ k = \\sqrt{\\frac{I}{A}} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Since it is derived from $I$ (length⁴) and $A$ (length²), the radius of gyration has units of length.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Application in Column Buckling</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The radius of gyration is a critical parameter in the analysis of column buckling. The slenderness ratio of a column, which determines whether it will fail by buckling or crushing, is given by $KL/k$, where $k$ is the least radius of gyration of the cross-section. A smaller radius of gyration means the column is more susceptible to buckling about that axis.</p>\n",
