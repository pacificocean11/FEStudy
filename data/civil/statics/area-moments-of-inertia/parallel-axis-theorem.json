Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>Parallel Axis Theorem</strong> is a crucial tool that allows you to calculate the moment of inertia of a shape about any axis, provided you know the moment of inertia about a parallel axis that passes through the shape's centroid.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. The Theorem</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The moment of inertia ($I$) about any axis is equal to the moment of inertia about a parallel centroidal axis ($I_c$), plus the product of the area ($A$) and the square of the perpendicular distance ($d$) between the two axes.</p>\n$$ I = I_c + A d^2 $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This theorem is fundamental for calculating the moment of inertia of composite shapes (like I-beams or T-beams) by summing the moments of inertia of their individual parts.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The same theorem applies to the polar moment of inertia ($J = J_c + A d^2$) and the product of inertia ($I_{xy} = I_{x'y'} + A d_x d_y$).</p>\n",

      "question": "The moment of inertia of a rectangle about its centroidal x-axis is $I_c = 100$ in⁴. The rectangle has an area of 20 in². What is the moment of inertia about a new axis parallel to the centroidal axis and located 5 inches away?",

      "explanation": "Use the Parallel Axis Theorem: $I = I_c + Ad^2$. Here, $I_c = 100$ in⁴, $A = 20$ in², and the distance $d = 5$ in. $I = 100 + (20)(5^2) = 100 + (20)(25) = 100 + 500 = 600$ in⁴."

      "question": "An I-beam is composed of three rectangular sections. To find the total moment of inertia of the entire I-beam shape about its overall centroidal axis, one must use which theorem for the top and bottom flanges?",

      "explanation": "To find the total moment of inertia of a composite shape, you sum the moments of inertia of its parts. For each part (like the top flange), you know its moment of inertia about its own centroid. The Parallel Axis Theorem is required to transfer the moment of inertia of the flange from its own centroidal axis to the centroidal axis of the entire I-beam shape."
