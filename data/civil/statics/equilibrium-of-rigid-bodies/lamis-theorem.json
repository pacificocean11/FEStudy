Statement of Lami's Theorem</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Lami's Theorem</strong> relates the magnitudes of three coplanar, concurrent forces that keep a particle in static equilibrium. It states that:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"border-l-4 border-slate-300 pl-4 italic my-4\">\n    If three coplanar forces acting at a point are in equilibrium, then each force is proportional to the sine of the angle between the other two forces.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. The Formula</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Let forces $F_1$, $F_2$, and $F_3$ act at a point. Let $\\alpha$ be the angle between $F_2$ and $F_3$, $\\beta$ be the angle between $F_1$ and $F_3$, and $\\gamma$ be the angle between $F_1$ and $F_2$.</p>\n$$ \\frac{F_1}{\\sin \\alpha} = \\frac{F_2}{\\sin \\beta} = \\frac{F_3}{\\sin \\gamma} $$\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Applicability</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Lami's theorem is derived from the sine rule for triangles. It is a very quick and convenient method for solving 3-force equilibrium problems, but it is strictly limited to situations where:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>There are exactly <strong>three</strong> forces.</li>\n    <li>The forces are <strong>coplanar</strong> (in the same plane).</li>\n    <li>The forces are <strong>concurrent</strong> (lines of action meet at a point).</li>\n    <li>The system is in <strong>equilibrium</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "explanation": "According to Lami's Theorem, the ratio of a force to the sine of the angle between the other two forces is constant. Here, the force A corresponds to the angle between B and C, which is 90°. The ratio is $100 / \\sin(90°) = 100 / 1 = 100$."
