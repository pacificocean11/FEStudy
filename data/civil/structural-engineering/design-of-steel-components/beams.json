Yielding (Plastic Moment)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For a compact, laterally supported beam, the nominal flexural strength is the plastic moment ($M_p$). This occurs when the entire cross-section has yielded.</p>\n$$ M_n = M_p = F_y Z_x $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$F_y$: Yield stress of the steel (e.g., 50 ksi).</li>\n    <li>$Z_x$: Plastic section modulus about the x-axis.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Lateral-Torsional Buckling (LTB)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">If the compression flange of a beam is not adequately braced, the beam may buckle laterally before reaching its full plastic moment. The strength depends on the unbraced length ($L_b$).</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Zone 1 (Plastic):</strong> $L_b \u2264 L_p$. The beam reaches $M_p$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Zone 2 (Inelastic LTB):</strong> $L_p < L_b \u2264 L_r$. The strength decreases linearly from $M_p$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Zone 3 (Elastic LTB):</strong> $L_b > L_r$. The strength is governed by elastic buckling (Euler-like).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Shear Strength</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The shear strength of rolled W-shapes is typically controlled by the area of the web ($A_w = d t_w$).</p>\n$$ V_n = 0.6 F_y A_w C_v $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For most W-beams, $C_v = 1.0$, and the design shear strength is $\u03D5 V_n$ with $\u03D5 = 1.0$ (LRFD).</p>\n",

      "explanation": "LTB is a buckling phenomenon of the compression flange. Just like a column, the compression portion of the beam wants to buckle sideways. If it is not braced, this instability can limit the beam's strength."
