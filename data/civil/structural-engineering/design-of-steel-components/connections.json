Types of Connections</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Simple Connections (Shear):</strong> Designed to transfer only shear forces (vertical reaction) from beam to column. They allow rotation and are modeled as pins. Examples: Double angle, single plate (shear tab).</li>\n    <li><strong>Moment Connections (Rigid):</strong> Designed to transfer both shear and moment. They restrict rotation and provide continuity. Examples: Flange-welded, end-plate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Bolted Connections</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Bolts can be loaded in shear, tension, or combined shear and tension.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Bearing-Type Connections:</strong> Load is transferred by the bolt bearing against the side of the hole. Limit states: Bolt shear, bearing strength of the plate, tear-out.</li>\n    <li><strong>Slip-Critical Connections:</strong> Load is transferred by friction between the faying surfaces of the connected parts. The bolts are pretensioned to create a clamping force. Used for fatigue or reversal loads.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Welded Connections</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Welds join metals by fusion.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Fillet Welds:</strong> The most common type. Designed based on the effective throat area. Strength is defined per inch of weld length.</li>\n    <li><strong>Groove Welds (CJP/PJP):</strong> Used to splice plates or connect members end-to-end. Complete Joint Penetration (CJP) develops the full strength of the base metal.</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "explanation": "Slip-critical connections are designed so that the friction force (generated by the clamping force of the tightened bolts) is greater than the applied shear load. This prevents the plates from slipping relative to each other."
