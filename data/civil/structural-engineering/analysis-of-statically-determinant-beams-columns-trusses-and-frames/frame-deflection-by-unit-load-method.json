Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>Unit Load Method</strong> (or virtual work) can also be used to find the deflection and rotation at any point on a frame. Unlike trusses, where internal work is due to axial deformation, the internal work in frames is primarily due to <strong>bending deformation</strong>. The contributions from axial and shear deformation are usually negligible and are ignored.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Virtual Work Formula for Frames</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The formula equates the external virtual work to the internal virtual strain energy due to bending.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>For Deflection:</strong></p>\n$$ 1 \\cdot \\Delta = \\int_L \\frac{mM}{EI} dx $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>For Rotation:</strong></p>\n$$ 1 \\cdot \\theta = \\int_L \\frac{m_\\theta M}{EI} dx $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$\\Delta$ or $\\theta$: The real deflection or rotation at the point of interest.</li>\n    <li>$M$: The internal moment equation as a function of position ($x$) due to the <strong>real loads</strong>.</li>\n    <li>$m$: The internal moment equation due to a <strong>virtual unit point load</strong> applied at the point and in the direction of the desired deflection.</li>\n    <li>$m_\\theta$: The internal moment equation due to a <strong>virtual unit couple moment</strong> applied at the point of desired rotation.</li>\n    <li>$E$: Modulus of elasticity.</li>\n    <li>$I$: Moment of inertia.</li>\n    <li>The integral is performed over the length ($L$) of all members in the frame.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Procedure</h3>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Real System:</strong> Analyze the frame with the actual loads to find the moment equation(s), $M(x)$, for each member.</li>\n    <li><strong>Virtual System:</strong> Remove all real loads. Apply a single virtual unit load or unit moment at the point of interest.</li>\n    <li>Analyze the frame again under this virtual load to find the virtual moment equation(s), $m(x)$ or $m_\\theta(x)$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Apply the Formula:</strong> For each member, set up and solve the integral $\\int (mM/EI) dx$. Sum the results for all members to get the total deflection or rotation.</li>\n</ol>\n",
