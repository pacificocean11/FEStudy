Its primary purpose is to use microorganisms (bacteria, protozoa, etc.) to remove the soluble organic matter (measured as BOD) and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from wastewater.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Activated Sludge Process</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This is the most common biological treatment process. It involves two main components:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Aeration Tank:</strong> Wastewater is mixed with a concentrated culture of microorganisms (the 'activated sludge'). Air is pumped into the tank to provide the oxygen needed for the aerobic bacteria to thrive and consume the organic 'food' (BOD).</li>\n    <li><strong>Secondary Clarifier:</strong> The mixture from the aeration tank (called mixed liquor) flows into a settling tank. Here, the microorganisms clump together to form a sludge that settles to the bottom, leaving clear, treated water (effluent) at the top.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A portion of the settled sludge, rich in microorganisms, is recycled back to the aeration tank. This is called <strong>Return Activated Sludge (RAS)</strong>. The excess sludge that is generated is removed from the system as <strong>Waste Activated Sludge (WAS)</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Key Operational Parameters</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Food-to-Microorganism (F/M) Ratio:</strong> The ratio of the incoming BOD ('food') to the mass of microorganisms in the aeration tank. It is a key control parameter.</li>\n    <li><strong>Mean Cell Residence Time (MCRT) or Solids Retention Time (SRT):</strong> The average amount of time the microorganisms are kept in the system before being wasted. Longer MCRTs are needed for nitrification (conversion of ammonia to nitrate).</li>\n</ul>\n",

      ],
      "explanation": "RAS is the process of returning a portion of the concentrated microorganisms from the bottom of the secondary clarifier to the beginning of the aeration tank. This ensures that a high concentration of active microorganisms is maintained in the reactor to efficiently treat the incoming wastewater."
