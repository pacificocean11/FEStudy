Stormwater Pollutants</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">As stormwater runs over impervious surfaces like roads, parking lots, and rooftops, it picks up a variety of pollutants. Common stormwater pollutants include:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Sediment:</strong> Soil particles eroded from construction sites and other bare land. This is the largest pollutant by volume.</li>\n    <li><strong>Nutrients:</strong> Nitrogen and phosphorus, primarily from fertilizers used on lawns.</li>\n    <li><strong>Heavy Metals:</strong> Zinc, copper, and lead, often from vehicle tire and brake wear.</li>\n    <li><strong>Oil and Grease:</strong> Leaks and drips from vehicles.</li>\n    <li><strong>Bacteria:</strong> From pet waste and sewer overflows.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. First Flush</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>'first flush'</strong> is the initial surface runoff of a rainstorm. During the dry period between storms, pollutants build up on impervious surfaces. The first portion of the runoff 'washes off' these accumulated pollutants, resulting in a runoff that has the highest concentration of pollutants. Stormwater quality BMPs are often designed specifically to capture and treat this first flush.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Best Management Practices (BMPs) for Quality</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">These are engineered systems designed to remove pollutants from stormwater runoff. Many are forms of Low Impact Development (LID).</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Retention Basins (Wet Ponds):</strong> The permanent pool of water allows sediment and associated pollutants to settle out. Biological processes in the pond can also remove nutrients.</li>\n    <li><strong>Constructed Wetlands:</strong> Shallow marsh systems that use wetland plants, soils, and their associated microorganisms to remove pollutants from stormwater.</li>\n    <li><strong>Infiltration Trenches/Basins:</strong> Trenches or basins filled with stone that temporarily store stormwater and allow it to soak into the ground, which naturally filters pollutants.</li>\n    <li><strong>Vegetated Swales:</strong> Grassy channels that slow down runoff, allowing for filtration and some infiltration.</li>\n</ul>\n",
