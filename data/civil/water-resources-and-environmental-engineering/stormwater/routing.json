Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Hydrologic routing</strong> is a technique used to predict the changes in a flood hydrograph as it moves through a river reach or a reservoir. It is the process of determining the outflow hydrograph at a downstream point, given an inflow hydrograph at an upstream point.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. The Continuity Equation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">All routing methods are based on the principle of conservation of mass, expressed by the continuity equation:</p>\n<p class=\"text-center font-semibold mb-4\">Inflow - Outflow = Change in Storage</p>\n$$ I(t) - O(t) = \\frac{dS}{dt} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$I(t)$ is the inflow rate at time t.</li>\n    <li>$O(t)$ is the outflow rate at time t.</li>\n    <li>$dS/dt$ is the rate of change of water volume stored in the system.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Reservoir Routing (Level Pool Routing)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This method is used to route a hydrograph through a reservoir or detention basin. It assumes that the water surface in the reservoir is perfectly horizontal. The method requires two key relationships for the reservoir:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Storage-Outflow Relationship:</strong> A curve or equation that relates the amount of water stored ($S$) in the reservoir to the outflow rate ($O$) from the outlet structure.</li>\n    <li><strong>Storage-Elevation Relationship:</strong> A curve or equation that relates the amount of water stored ($S$) to the water surface elevation ($h$).</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Given an inflow hydrograph, the continuity equation is solved in discrete time steps to calculate the outflow hydrograph and the changing water level in the basin.</p>\n",
