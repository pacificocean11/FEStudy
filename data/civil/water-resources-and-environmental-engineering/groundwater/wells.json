Pumping Wells</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A well is a structure created in the ground by digging, driving, or drilling to access groundwater in an aquifer. Pumping water from the well lowers the water level in the aquifer surrounding the well, creating a 'cone of depression'.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Steady-State Flow to a Well</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">When a well has been pumping at a constant rate for a long time, the water levels may stabilize, reaching a steady-state condition where the shape of the cone of depression is no longer changing. The flow rate can be related to the water levels (head) in the aquifer.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Thiem Equation for a Confined Aquifer</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The Thiem equation describes steady-state, radial flow to a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer.</p>\n$$ Q = \\frac{2\\pi T (h_2 - h_1)}{\\ln(r_2/r_1)} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$Q$: Pumping rate (m³/s).</li>\n    <li>$T$: Transmissivity of the aquifer (m²/s). Transmissivity is the hydraulic conductivity ($K$) multiplied by the aquifer thickness ($b$), $T=Kb$.</li>\n    <li>$h_1$ and $h_2$: Hydraulic heads (water level elevations) at two observation wells.</li>\n    <li>$r_1$ and $r_2$: Distances of the two observation wells from the pumping well.</li>\n</ul>\n",
