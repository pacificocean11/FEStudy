Definition of Drawdown</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Drawdown ($s$)</strong> is the vertical drop in hydraulic head at a given location in an aquifer due to pumping. It is the difference between the static (non-pumping) water level and the water level during pumping.</p>\n$$ s = h_0 - h $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$s$ is the drawdown.</li>\n    <li>$h_0$ is the static hydraulic head before pumping.</li>\n    <li>$h$ is the hydraulic head during pumping.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Cone of Depression</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The drawdown is not uniform around a well. It is greatest at the well itself and decreases with distance from the well, forming a three-dimensional cone shape in the water table or potentiometric surface, known as the <strong>cone of depression</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Radius of Influence</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>radius of influence</strong> is the maximum horizontal distance from the center of a pumping well at which the drawdown is no longer perceptible. Beyond this radius, the water level is essentially unaffected by the pumping.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Well Interference</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Well interference</strong> occurs when the cones of depression of two or more pumping wells overlap. The total drawdown at any point in the area of overlap is the sum of the drawdowns that would be caused by each well pumping individually. This means that wells placed too close together will be less efficient, as they will have to lift water from a lower level than if they were operating alone.</p>\n",
