It is the sum of all titratable bases in the water. In most natural waters, alkalinity is primarily due to bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻), carbonate (CO₃²⁻), and hydroxide (OH⁻) ions. Alkalinity provides a buffering capacity that resists changes in pH.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Hardness</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Hardness is the concentration of multivalent cations in water. The most common hardness-causing ions are calcium (Ca²⁺) and magnesium (Mg²⁺).</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Carbonate Hardness (CH):</strong> Hardness associated with bicarbonate and carbonate ions. It is also called 'temporary hardness' because it can be removed by boiling.</li>\n    <li><strong>Non-carbonate Hardness (NCH):</strong> Hardness associated with other anions like sulfate (SO₄²⁻), chloride (Cl⁻), and nitrate (NO₃⁻). It is called 'permanent hardness'.</li>\n    <li><strong>Total Hardness (TH):</strong> The sum of carbonate and non-carbonate hardness. $TH = CH + NCH$.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Dissolved Solids</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)</strong> is a measure of the total concentration of all dissolved substances in water, both inorganic and organic. It is determined by filtering a water sample and then evaporating the filtered liquid to dryness and weighing the residue.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Dissolved Gases</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Gases from the atmosphere can dissolve in water. The solubility of gases in water is governed by Henry's Law and is highly dependent on temperature.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Dissolved Oxygen (DO):</strong> Crucial for the survival of fish and other aquatic organisms. The solubility of oxygen decreases as water temperature increases.</li>\n    <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):</strong> Dissolved CO₂ forms carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), which is a key component of the carbonate buffer system that controls pH and alkalinity in natural waters.</li>\n</ul>\n",

        { "text": "It decreases.", "isCorrect": true },

        { "text": "It depends on the pH.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The solubility of gases in water is inversely related to temperature. As the water gets warmer, its ability to hold dissolved oxygen decreases. This is why low DO levels are often a problem in the summer."
