Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Hydrologic routing</strong> is the technique used to trace the movement of a flood wave (hydrograph) through a hydrologic system, such as a river channel or a reservoir. The goal is to predict the shape of the hydrograph at a downstream location, given its shape at an upstream location.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. The Continuity Equation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">All routing methods are based on the principle of conservation of mass, expressed by the continuity equation:</p>\n<p class=\"text-center font-semibold mb-4\">Inflow - Outflow = Change in Storage</p>\n$$ I(t) - O(t) = \\frac{dS}{dt} $$\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Reservoir Routing</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Reservoir routing is used to model the effect of a reservoir on a flood hydrograph. As a flood wave enters a reservoir, water is stored, and the outflow is typically controlled by a spillway or outlet structure.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The effect of the reservoir's storage is to <strong>attenuate</strong> the flood peak. This means:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>The peak of the outflow hydrograph will be <strong>lower</strong> than the peak of the inflow hydrograph.</li>\n    <li>The peak of the outflow hydrograph will occur <strong>later</strong> in time than the peak of the inflow hydrograph.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This peak flow reduction is the primary mechanism by which reservoirs provide flood control.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Channel Routing</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Channel routing models the movement of a flood wave down a river reach. As the wave moves, it also attenuates and becomes more spread out due to storage within the channel and frictional resistance.</p>\n",

        { "text": "It decreases the peak flow but does not change its timing.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "By temporarily storing a portion of the flood volume, a reservoir reduces the maximum outflow rate (peak attenuation) and spreads the outflow over a longer period, causing the peak to occur later in time."
