  "notes": "\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">1. Sound Pressure and Decibels (dB)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Noise is unwanted sound. Sound is a pressure wave, and its intensity is measured on a logarithmic scale called the decibel (dB) scale. This scale more closely approximates the human ear's perception of loudness.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A 10 dB increase represents a tenfold increase in sound intensity and is perceived as roughly twice as loud.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. A-Weighting (dBA)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The human ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies. It is most sensitive to frequencies in the range of human speech (around 1-4 kHz) and less sensitive to very low and very high frequencies. The <strong>A-weighting scale</strong> is an electronic filter applied to sound level meters to make their readings more closely match what the human ear actually hears. Measurements made with this filter are expressed in <strong>dBA</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Noise Regulations (OSHA)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">OSHA regulates occupational noise exposure to protect against hearing loss. The key standards are:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL):</strong> The legal limit is a Time-Weighted Average (TWA) of <strong>90 dBA</strong> for an 8-hour workday.</li>\n    <li><strong>Action Level:</strong> An 8-hour TWA of <strong>85 dBA</strong>. When exposure reaches or exceeds this level, employers must implement a hearing conservation program.</li>\n    <li><strong>Exchange Rate:</strong> OSHA uses a 5-dB exchange rate. This means that for every 5 dB increase in noise level, the allowable exposure time is cut in half. For example, the allowable exposure time at 95 dBA is 4 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n",
