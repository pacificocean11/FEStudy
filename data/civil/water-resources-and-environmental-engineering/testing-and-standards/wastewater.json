Common Wastewater Quality Parameters</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD):</strong> The amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample. It's a measure of the organic pollution. A 5-day test (BOD₅) is the standard.</li>\n    <li><strong>Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD):</strong> The amount of oxygen required to chemically oxidize both organic and inorganic compounds in water. The COD value is always higher than the BOD value for the same sample.</li>\n    <li><strong>Total Suspended Solids (TSS):</strong> The total amount of solid material that is suspended (not dissolved) in the water. High TSS can block light and harm aquatic life.</li>\n    <li><strong>Nutrients (Nitrogen and Phosphorus):</strong> Excess nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater can lead to eutrophication (over-enrichment) in receiving water bodies, causing algae blooms that deplete dissolved oxygen.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Clean Water Act (CWA)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The CWA is the primary federal law in the U.S. governing water pollution. Its objective is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES):</strong> The CWA established the NPDES permit program to control water pollution by regulating point sources (like pipes from industrial facilities and wastewater treatment plants) that discharge pollutants into waters of the United States.</li>\n</ul>\n",
