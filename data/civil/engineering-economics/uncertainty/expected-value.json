Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Expected Value (EV)</strong>, or Expected Monetary Value (EMV), is a concept used to aid decision-making under uncertainty. It is a weighted average of all possible outcomes of a decision, where the weighting factor for each outcome is its probability of occurrence. It represents the long-run average outcome if a decision were to be repeated many times.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Calculation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For a set of discrete, mutually exclusive outcomes, the expected value is calculated by multiplying the value (payoff) of each outcome by its probability and summing the results.</p>\n$$ E[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i P(x_i) $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$E[X]$ is the expected value.</li>\n    <li>$x_i$ is the value of the $i$-th outcome.</li>\n    <li>$P(x_i)$ is the probability of the $i$-th outcome occurring.</li>\n    <li>The sum of all probabilities must equal 1 ($\\sum P(x_i) = 1$).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Decision Rule</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">When comparing alternatives, the one with the most favorable expected value (e.g., highest expected profit or lowest expected cost) is the preferred choice.</p>\n",

      "question": "A contractor is bidding on a project. They estimate a 40% chance of winning the bid, which would result in a profit of $100,000. There is a 60% chance of losing the bid, which would result in a loss of $10,000 (the cost of preparing the bid). What is the expected monetary value of bidding on this project?",
