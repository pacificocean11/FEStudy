Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Future Worth (FW)</strong>, also known as Future Value (FV), is the value of a present amount or a series of payments at a specified date in the future, at a given interest rate. FW analysis is used to determine the future value of an investment.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Key Formulas (Interest Factors)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The formulas are often expressed using standard factor notation, where (X/Y, i, n) means \"Find X, given Y, at interest rate i for n periods\".</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Find F, given P (Single Payment Compound Amount Factor, F/P):</strong><br>This calculates the future value of a single present amount.\n    $$ F = P(1+i)^n = P(F/P, i, n)$$\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Find F, given A (Uniform Series Compound Amount Factor, F/A):</strong><br>This calculates the future value of a uniform series of payments (annuity).\n    $$ F = A \\left[ \\frac{(1+i)^n - 1}{i} \\right] = A(F/A, i, n)$$\n    </li>\n</ul>\n",
