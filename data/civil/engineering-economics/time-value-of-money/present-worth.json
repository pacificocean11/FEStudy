Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Present Worth (PW)</strong>, also known as Present Value (PV), is the current value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows, given a specified rate of return. Present worth analysis is one of the most common methods for comparing investment alternatives. It brings all future costs and revenues back to a single equivalent value at time zero.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Key Formulas (Interest Factors)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The formulas are often expressed using standard factor notation, where (X/Y, i, n) means \"Find X, given Y, at interest rate i for n periods\".</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Find P, given F (Single Payment Present Worth Factor, P/F):</strong><br>This calculates the present value of a single future amount.\n    $$ P = F(1+i)^{-n} = F(P/F, i, n)$$\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Find P, given A (Uniform Series Present Worth Factor, P/A):</strong><br>This calculates the present value of a uniform series of payments (annuity).\n    $$ P = A \\left[ \\frac{(1+i)^n - 1}{i(1+i)^n} \\right] = A(P/A, i, n)$$\n    </li>\n</ul>\n",
