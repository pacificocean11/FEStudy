Definitions</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Total labor costs on a project can be broken down into direct and indirect costs.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Direct Labor Costs:</strong> These are the wages and benefits paid to workers who are directly involved in the physical construction of the project. Their work can be easily and directly traced to a specific work item. Examples include carpenters, concrete finishers, and equipment operators.</li>\n    <li><strong>Indirect Labor Costs:</strong> These are the wages and benefits for employees who are necessary for the project but do not work directly on the physical installation. Their time is not easily attributable to a single work item. Examples include project managers, superintendents, safety officers, and administrative staff. These costs are typically part of the project's overhead.</li>\n</ul>\n",
