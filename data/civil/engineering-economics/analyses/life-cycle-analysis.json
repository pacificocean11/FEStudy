Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA)</strong> is an economic analysis technique that considers all costs associated with a project or asset over its entire life. It is a 'cradle-to-grave' economic assessment.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">LCCA is particularly useful for comparing alternatives where one option has a low initial cost but high future costs, while another has a high initial cost but low future costs (e.g., choosing between different pavement types or HVAC systems).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Costs Included in LCCA</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A complete LCCA includes costs from all stages of the life cycle:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Initial Costs:</strong> Purchase price, acquisition, installation, and design costs.</li>\n    <li><strong>Operating and Maintenance (O&M) Costs:</strong> Energy, fuel, labor, and other recurring costs.</li>\n    <li><strong>Repair and Replacement Costs:</strong> Scheduled major repairs and component replacements.</li>\n    <li><strong>Disposal Costs:</strong> Costs to decommission and dispose of the asset at the end of its life.</li>\n    <li><strong>Salvage Value:</strong> Any revenue received from selling the asset at the end of its life (treated as a negative cost or a benefit).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Analysis Method</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">To perform an LCCA, all costs and revenues over the life cycle are brought to a common point in time using an appropriate interest rate (discount rate). The most common methods are calculating the total <strong>Present Worth (PW)</strong> of all costs or the <strong>Equivalent Annual Worth (EAW)</strong>. The alternative with the lowest total life cycle cost is then selected.</p>\n",
