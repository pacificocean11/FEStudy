The total ultimate capacity ($Q_{ult}$) is the sum of two components:</p>\n$$ Q_{ult} = Q_p + Q_s $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Point (or Tip) Bearing ($Q_p$):</strong> The load carried by the soil at the tip of the pile. $Q_p = q_p A_p$, where $q_p$ is the unit bearing capacity of the soil at the tip and $A_p$ is the area of the pile tip.</li>\n    <li><strong>Skin Friction (or Side Resistance) ($Q_s$):</strong> The load carried by friction (or adhesion) along the shaft of the pile. $Q_s = \\sum f_s A_s$, where $f_s$ is the unit skin friction and $A_s$ is the surface area of the pile shaft.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Capacity in Clay ($\u03B1$-method)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For piles in clay, the skin friction is calculated using the undrained shear strength ($s_u$ or $c_u$).</p>\n$$ f_s = \\alpha s_u $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Where $\\alpha$ is an adhesion factor (typically 0.5 to 1.0) that depends on the clay strength. The tip capacity is $q_p = 9 s_u$.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Capacity in Sand ($\u03B2$-method)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For piles in sand, capacity depends on the effective stress ($\\sigma'_v$).</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Skin Friction:</strong> $f_s = K \\sigma'_v \\tan(\\delta) = \\beta \\sigma'_v$. It increases with depth.</li>\n    <li><strong>Tip Bearing:</strong> $q_p = \\sigma'_v N_q$. It also increases with depth.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Group Efficiency</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">When piles are driven close together in a group, their behavior interacts. The capacity of the group is not always the sum of the individual capacities. In clay, 'block failure' of the entire group must be checked. In sand, the group capacity is often taken as the sum of the individuals (efficiency $\\approx$ 1).</p>\n",

      "explanation": "Skin friction capacity is $Q_s = f_s A_s$. First, find the unit skin friction: $f_s = \\alpha s_u = 0.8 \\times 50 = 40$ kPa. Next, find the surface area of the pile shaft: $A_s = \\text{Perimeter} \\times \\text{Length} = (4 \\times 0.3) \\times 10 = 1.2 \\times 10 = 12$ m². Finally, $Q_s = 40 \\text{ kPa} \\times 12 \\text{ m²} = 480$ kN."
