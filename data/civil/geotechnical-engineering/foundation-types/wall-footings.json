Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>wall footing</strong>, also known as a <strong>strip footing</strong>, is a continuous strip of concrete that serves to spread the weight of a load-bearing wall over a larger area of soil. It is a type of shallow foundation.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Purpose and Use</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Wall footings are used to support linear loads from foundation walls, retaining walls, or load-bearing architectural walls. The continuous nature of the footing ensures that the load is distributed evenly along the length of the wall.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Design</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The primary design consideration for a wall footing is its width ($B$). The width must be sufficient to ensure that the bearing pressure exerted on the soil does not exceed the allowable soil bearing capacity ($q_{allow}$).</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The analysis is typically done per unit length of the wall (e.g., per foot or per meter). The bearing pressure ($q$) is calculated as:</p>\n$$ q = \\frac{P}{B} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Where $P$ is the load from the wall per unit length (e.g., in lb/ft or kN/m). The required width is then:</p>\n$$ B_{req} \\ge \\frac{P}{q_{allow}} $$\n",
