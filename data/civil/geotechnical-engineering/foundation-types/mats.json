Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>mat foundation</strong>, also known as a <strong>raft foundation</strong>, is a large, thick, continuous concrete slab that supports the entire structure (all columns and walls) and rests directly on the soil. It is a type of shallow foundation that covers the entire footprint of the building.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. When to Use a Mat Foundation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Mat foundations are used under one or more of the following conditions:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Low Soil Bearing Capacity:</strong> When the soil is weak and/or compressible, a mat is used to spread the heavy building loads over a very large area, resulting in a low bearing pressure.</li>\n    <li><strong>Heavy Loads:</strong> For structures with very heavy and closely spaced column loads, such as high-rise buildings, where individual spread footings would be so large that they would nearly touch or overlap.</li>\n    <li><strong>Minimize Differential Settlement:</strong> A mat foundation is very rigid and can bridge over variations in soil conditions, helping to minimize differential settlement (uneven sinking) across the building.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Design Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A mat foundation is designed as an inverted two-way slab. The soil pressure acting upward on the bottom of the slab is the 'distributed load', and the columns and walls are the 'supports' pushing downward on the slab.</p>\n",
