Phase Relationships</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Index properties are used to describe the state of a soil, particularly the relative proportions of solids, water, and air. Key properties include:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Water Content ($w$):</strong> Ratio of the weight of water to the weight of solids ($W_w/W_s$).</li>\n    <li><strong>Void Ratio ($e$):</strong> Ratio of the volume of voids to the volume of solids ($V_v/V_s$).</li>\n    <li><strong>Porosity ($n$):</strong> Ratio of the volume of voids to the total volume ($V_v/V_t$). $n = e/(1+e)$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Degree of Saturation ($S$):</strong> Ratio of the volume of water to the volume of voids ($V_w/V_v$).</li>\n    <li><strong>Specific Gravity ($G_s$):</strong> Ratio of the unit weight of solids to the unit weight of water (typically 2.6-2.8).</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The fundamental relationship connecting these is: $Se = wG_s$.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Atterberg Limits</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">These limits define the water content boundaries between different states of fine-grained soils (clays and silts):</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Liquid Limit ($LL$):</strong> The water content at the boundary between the liquid and plastic states.</li>\n    <li><strong>Plastic Limit ($PL$):</strong> The water content at the boundary between the plastic and semi-solid states.</li>\n    <li><strong>Plasticity Index ($PI$):</strong> The range of water contents over which the soil behaves plastically. $PI = LL - PL$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Liquidity Index ($LI$):</strong> Compares the natural water content ($w_n$) to the limits. $LI = (w_n - PL) / PI$. If $LI > 1$, the soil is in a liquid state.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Particle Size Distribution</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Coefficient of Uniformity ($C_u$):</strong> $D_{60}/D_{10}$. Indicates the range of particle sizes.<br>\n<strong>Coefficient of Curvature ($C_c$):</strong> $D_{30}^2 / (D_{10} \\times D_{60})$. Indicates the shape of the gradation curve.<br>\nA well-graded soil has a wide range of sizes ($C_u$ is high) and a smooth curve ($C_c$ between 1 and 3).</p>\n",

      "explanation": "Use the fundamental relationship $Se = wG_s$. Since the soil is saturated, $S = 1$ (or 100%). Convert water content to a decimal: $w = 0.25$. So, $1 \\cdot e = 0.25 \\cdot 2.70$. $e = 0.675$."
