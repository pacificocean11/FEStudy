The Linear Momentum Equation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The linear momentum equation for a control volume with one inlet and one outlet in steady flow is a vector equation:</p>\n$$ \\sum \\mathbf{F} = \\dot{m}(\\mathbf{v}_{out} - \\mathbf{v}_{in}) $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">To solve problems, this is typically broken down into its scalar components in the x and y directions:</p>\n$$ \\sum F_x = \\dot{m}(v_{x,out} - v_{x,in}) $$$$ \\sum F_y = \\dot{m}(v_{y,out} - v_{y,in}) $$\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Forces Acting on the Control Volume</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The term $\\sum \\mathbf{F}$ includes all external forces acting on the fluid inside the control volume. These are:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Pressure Forces:</strong> Pressure from the fluid outside the control volume acts on the inlet and outlet areas ($P \cdot A$).</li>\n    <li><strong>Body Forces:</strong> The weight of the fluid in the control volume ($mg$). This is often negligible for gases or horizontal pipes.</li>\n    <li><strong>Reaction Forces:</strong> The forces exerted by solid surfaces (like pipe walls or bends) on the fluid. These are often the unknown forces we want to find. For a pipe bend, these are the anchoring forces ($R_x$ and $R_y$).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Solving a Problem</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The typical procedure is:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>Select a control volume that encloses the feature of interest (e.g., a pipe bend).</li>\n    <li>Draw a free-body diagram showing all the forces acting on the fluid within the control volume.</li>\n    <li>Determine the velocities and mass flow rate.</li>\n    <li>Apply the momentum equation in the x and y directions to solve for the unknown reaction forces.</li>\n</ol>\n",

      "question": "A jet of water strikes a stationary flat plate perpendicularly. The momentum equation is used to find the force on the plate. What is the final velocity of the water in the direction of the jet?",
      "options": [
        { "text": "Equal to the initial velocity.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Zero.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "Twice the initial velocity.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Half the initial velocity.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "When the jet strikes the plate, its momentum in the original direction of flow (let's say the x-direction) is completely destroyed. The water spreads out along the plate, so its final velocity component in the x-direction is zero. The change in momentum is then used to calculate the force."
