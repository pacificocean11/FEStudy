Stress in Fluids</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Normal Stress:</strong> Acts perpendicular to a surface. Pressure is a type of normal stress.</li>\n    <li><strong>Shear Stress ($\\tau$):</strong> Acts parallel or tangential to a surface. It arises from the friction between fluid layers moving at different velocities. A key property of a fluid is that it cannot sustain a shear stress when at rest.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Pressure (P)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Pressure is the compressive normal stress exerted by a fluid. The pressure at a point in a fluid at rest is the same in all directions (Pascal's Law).</p>\n$$ P = \\frac{F_{normal}}{A} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Units:</strong> Pascals (Pa), where 1 Pa = 1 N/m².</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Viscosity ($\\mu$)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to shear or angular deformation. It can be thought of as the 'thickness' or internal friction of a fluid.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Newton's Law of Viscosity:</strong> For many common fluids (Newtonian fluids), the shear stress is directly proportional to the rate of strain (velocity gradient).</p>\n$$ \\tau = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$\\tau$ is the shear stress.</li>\n    <li>$\\mu$ is the dynamic (or absolute) viscosity. <strong>Units:</strong> Pa·s or N·s/m².</li>\n    <li>$\\frac{du}{dy}$ is the velocity gradient perpendicular to the flow.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Kinematic Viscosity ($\\nu$)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Kinematic viscosity is the ratio of the dynamic viscosity to the density of the fluid.</p>\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Units:</strong> m²/s.</li>\n</ul>\n",
