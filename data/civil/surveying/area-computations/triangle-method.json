      "question": "A triangular parcel of land has sides measuring 300 ft, 400 ft, and 500 ft. What is the area of the parcel?",
      "options": [
        { "text": "120,000 sq ft", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "75,000 sq ft", "isCorrect": false },

        { "text": "50,000 sq ft", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Since all three sides are known, use Heron's formula. First, calculate the semi-perimeter, s: $s = (300+400+500)/2 = 1200/2 = 600$. Now, calculate the area: $Area = \\sqrt{600(600-300)(600-400)(600-500)} = \\sqrt{600(300)(200)(100)} = \\sqrt{3,600,000,000} = 60,000$ sq ft. (Alternatively, recognize this is a 3-4-5 right triangle, so the area is $1/2 \\times base \\times height = 1/2 \\times 300 \\times 400 = 60,000$ sq ft)."

      "explanation": "Use the formula for two sides and an included angle: $Area = 1/2 ab \\sin(C)$. $Area = 1/2 (150)(200) \\sin(45^\\circ) = (15000) (0.7071) \\approx 10,607$ sq ft."
