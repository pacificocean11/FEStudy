Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Differential leveling</strong> is the most common method of leveling used by surveyors to determine the difference in elevation between two points. It involves using a surveying instrument called a level, which establishes a horizontal line of sight, and a graduated leveling rod.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Basic Procedure</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The process involves a series of instrument setups and readings:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>Set up the level at a location where you can see a point of known elevation (a <strong>benchmark, BM</strong>) and a point of unknown elevation.</li>\n    <li>Take a reading on the leveling rod held on the benchmark. This reading is called a <strong>backsight (BS)</strong>.</li>\n    <li>Calculate the <strong>Height of Instrument (HI)</strong>. This is the elevation of the horizontal line of sight.</li>\n    $$ HI = Elevation_{BM} + BS $$\n    <li>Move the rod to a point of unknown elevation and take a reading. This is a <strong>foresight (FS)</strong>.</li>\n    <li>Calculate the elevation of the new point.</li>\n    $$ Elevation_{New Point} = HI - FS $$\n</ol>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This process can be repeated by moving the instrument, using the new point as a <strong>turning point (TP)</strong> to establish a new HI.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Field Notes and Checks</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Surveyors keep meticulous field notes in a table format. A common arithmetic check is to ensure that the sum of all backsights minus the sum of all foresights equals the difference between the starting and ending elevations.</p>\n$$ \\sum BS - \\sum FS = Elevation_{End} - Elevation_{Start} $$\n",
