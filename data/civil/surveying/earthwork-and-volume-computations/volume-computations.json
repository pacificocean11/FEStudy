Average End Area Method</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This is the most common method for calculating earthwork volumes between two cross-sections (stations).</p>\n$$ V = L \\frac{A_1 + A_2}{2} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$V$: Volume between stations.</li>\n    <li>$A_1, A_2$: Cross-sectional areas at the two stations.</li>\n    <li>$L$: Distance between stations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This method is exact only if the cross-sectional areas change linearly.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Prismoidal Formula</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The Prismoidal Formula provides a more accurate volume calculation, especially when the ground profile is irregular or when there is a significant difference between the end areas.</p>\n$$ V = \\frac{L}{6} (A_1 + 4A_m + A_2) $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$A_m$: Cross-sectional area at the midpoint between the two stations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Borrow Pit Method (Grid Method)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Used for site grading volume calculations where a grid of elevations is established. The volume of cut or fill within each grid cell is calculated by multiplying the cell area by the average depth of cut/fill at the corners.</p>\n",

      "question": "Using the Average End Area method, calculate the volume of fill between two stations 100 ft apart. The fill area at Station 1 is 200 sq ft, and the fill area at Station 2 is 300 sq ft.",
      "options": [
        { "text": "25,000 cubic ft", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "50,000 cubic ft", "isCorrect": false },

        { "text": "Both A and C", "isCorrect": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "Volume = L * (A1 + A2) / 2 = 100 * (200 + 300) / 2 = 100 * 250 = 25,000 cubic feet. To convert to cubic yards, divide by 27: 25,000 / 27 = 925.9 cubic yards."

      "question": "The Prismoidal Formula is generally considered more accurate than the Average End Area method because:",
      "options": [
        { "text": "It uses three cross-sectional areas instead of two.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "It is easier to calculate.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "It ignores the middle section.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "It assumes linear variation between end areas.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The Prismoidal Formula accounts for the curvature of the solid between the two end sections by including the area of the mid-section ($A_m$), providing a better approximation for solids that are not simple prisms."
