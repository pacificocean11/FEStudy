  "notes": "\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">1. Cut and Fill</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In construction projects, earthwork often involves excavation (cut) and embankment (fill). Balancing cut and fill volumes minimizes the need for importing or exporting soil.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Cut:</strong> Removing soil or rock to lower the ground elevation.</li>\n    <li><strong>Fill:</strong> Placing soil or rock to raise the ground elevation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Cross-Sectional Areas</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">To compute earthwork volumes for linear projects like roads, the project is divided into stations. At each station, the cross-sectional area of cut and/or fill is determined.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The area can be calculated using coordinates or geometric shapes (triangles and trapezoids).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Shrinkage and Swell</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Soil volume changes when it is moved.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Bank Volume (In-Place):</strong> Soil in its natural state.</li>\n    <li><strong>Loose Volume (Excavated):</strong> Soil after excavation. It swells (volume increases).</li>\n    <li><strong>Compacted Volume (Fill):</strong> Soil after compaction. It often shrinks (volume decreases) relative to bank volume.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Earthwork calculations must account for these factors to accurately estimate haul quantities.</p>\n",
