Geographic Coordinate System</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The latitude and longitude system is a <strong>geographic coordinate system</strong> used to specify the position of any point on the Earth's surface. It is a spherical or ellipsoidal coordinate system that is based on angles measured from the Earth's center.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Latitude</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Latitude is the angular distance of a point north or south of the Earth's equator.</li>\n    <li><strong>Lines:</strong> Lines of equal latitude are called <strong>parallels</strong>. They are parallel to the equator and run east-west.</li>\n    <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> Latitude is measured in degrees, from 0° at the equator to 90° North at the North Pole and 90° South at the South Pole.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Longitude</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Longitude is the angular distance of a point east or west of a reference meridian.</li>\n    <li><strong>Lines:</strong> Lines of equal longitude are called <strong>meridians</strong>. They run from the North Pole to the South Pole.</li>\n    <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> The reference meridian is the <strong>Prime Meridian</strong>, which passes through Greenwich, England, and is defined as 0° longitude. Longitude is measured in degrees, from 0° to 180° East and 180° West.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Units</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Coordinates are traditionally expressed in degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS). There are 60 minutes (') in a degree and 60 seconds (\") in a minute. They can also be expressed in decimal degrees.</p>\n",
