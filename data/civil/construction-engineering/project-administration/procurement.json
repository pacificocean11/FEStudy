Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Procurement</strong> is the process of acquiring the goods and services needed to complete a project. In construction, this primarily refers to the process of selecting and hiring a contractor.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Competitive Bidding</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This is the most common procurement method for public projects (funded by taxpayer money). It is designed to be open, fair, and to obtain the lowest price for the work.</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Advertisement/Solicitation:</strong> The project is publicly advertised, inviting all qualified contractors to submit a bid.</li>\n    <li><strong>Bid Submission:</strong> Bidders prepare a detailed cost estimate and submit a sealed bid by a specific deadline.</li>\n    <li><strong>Bid Opening:</strong> All bids are opened publicly at the designated time, and the prices are read aloud.</li>\n    <li><strong>Bid Evaluation:</strong> The owner (or their representative) evaluates the bids to ensure they are complete and conform to the requirements.</li>\n    <li><strong>Contract Award:</strong> The contract is typically awarded to the <strong>'lowest responsive, responsible bidder'</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Bidder Qualifications</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Responsive Bidder:</strong> A bidder who has submitted a bid that conforms to all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids (e.g., filled out the bid form correctly, included a required bid bond).</li>\n    <li><strong>Responsible Bidder:</strong> A bidder who is deemed to be qualified, with the financial and technical capacity to perform the work.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Negotiation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In private projects, the owner is not always required to select the lowest bidder. They may choose to negotiate a price and contract terms with one or more pre-selected contractors based on qualifications, reputation, and other factors.</p>\n",

      "explanation": "A 'responsive' bidder is one who has complied with all the procedural requirements of the bid invitation. Failing to include a required document like a bid bond makes the bid non-responsive, and it will typically be rejected, even if it is the lowest price."
