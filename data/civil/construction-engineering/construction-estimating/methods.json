Types of Estimates</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Estimates vary in accuracy depending on the stage of the project:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Conceptual (Parametric) Estimate:</strong> Used in early planning. Relies on statistical relationships between historical costs and key project parameters (e.g., cost per square foot, cost per parking space). Accuracy: ±20-30%.</li>\n    <li><strong>Detailed (Unit Price) Estimate:</strong> Used for bidding. Requires complete drawings and specs. Costs are built up item by item using detailed quantity takeoffs and unit prices for labor, material, and equipment. Accuracy: ±5-10%.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Unit Cost Method</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The most common method for detailed estimating. The total cost is the sum of the costs for each line item.</p>\n$$ \\text{Total Cost} = \\sum (\\text{Quantity} \\times \\text{Unit Price}) $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The unit price typically includes:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Material Cost:</strong> Purchase price + sales tax + delivery.</li>\n    <li><strong>Labor Cost:</strong> Hourly wage + burden (benefits, taxes, insurance).</li>\n    <li><strong>Equipment Cost:</strong> Rental or ownership cost + operating cost.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Indirect Costs</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In addition to direct costs (material, labor, equipment), the estimate must include:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Project Overhead (General Conditions):</strong> Site-specific costs like the job trailer, temporary utilities, and site supervision.</li>\n    <li><strong>General Overhead:</strong> Home office expenses allocated to the project.</li>\n    <li><strong>Profit:</strong> The contractor's fee.</li>\n    <li><strong>Contingency:</strong> A reserve fund for unforeseen costs.</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "explanation": "Parametric estimating uses statistical relationships between historical data and other variables (like square footage) to calculate an estimate. It is quick and requires little design detail, making it suitable for early conceptual planning."

        { "text": "Contingency", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "These are costs that are specific to the project and necessary for its completion, but they cannot be directly attributed to a specific work item like pouring concrete. Therefore, they are classified as project overhead or 'General Conditions' costs."
