  "notes": "\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">1. Scope of Work</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The most critical requirement for an accurate construction estimate is a clear and defined <strong>scope of work</strong>. This is a detailed description of the work to be performed, including all tasks, deliverables, and boundaries of the project.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Contract Documents</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Estimates are based on the information provided in the contract documents, which typically include:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Drawings (Plans):</strong> Visual representation of the project geometry, dimensions, and locations.</li>\n    <li><strong>Specifications (Specs):</strong> Written descriptions of materials, workmanship standards, and quality requirements.</li>\n    <li><strong>Addenda:</strong> Changes made to the documents during the bidding process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Quantity Takeoff (QTO)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Before costs can be applied, the quantity of every material and work item must be calculated from the drawings. This process is called a <strong>quantity takeoff</strong>. Accuracy in the QTO is essential, as errors here propagate directly to the final cost.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</strong> is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work into smaller, manageable components. It helps organize the estimate and ensures that no parts of the project are overlooked.</p>\n",

      "explanation": "A QTO is the systematic process of measuring and listing the quantities of all materials and work items (like cubic yards of concrete, linear feet of pipe) directly from the project drawings. This quantity data forms the foundation for the cost estimate."
