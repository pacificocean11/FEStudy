Critical Path Method (CPM)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The Critical Path Method is a project modeling technique used to find the longest sequence of dependent tasks and measure the total project duration. This sequence of tasks is known as the 'critical path'.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Key Terminology</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Activity:</strong> A single task or piece of work in a project.</li>\n    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> The amount of time required to complete an activity.</li>\n    <li><strong>Early Start (ES):</strong> The earliest possible time an activity can begin, assuming all predecessor activities start at their earliest possible times.</li>\n    <li><strong>Early Finish (EF):</strong> The earliest possible time an activity can be completed. $EF = ES + Duration$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Late Finish (LF):</strong> The latest possible time an activity can be completed without delaying the project's overall completion date.</li>\n    <li><strong>Late Start (LS):</strong> The latest possible time an activity can begin without delaying the project's overall completion date. $LS = LF - Duration$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Float (or Slack):</strong> The amount of time an activity can be delayed without affecting the project's final completion date. Float = $LS - ES$ or $LF - EF$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Critical Path:</strong> The sequence of activities that have zero float. Any delay to an activity on the critical path will directly delay the entire project. It is the longest duration path through the network diagram.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Forward and Backward Pass</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The ES and EF times are calculated by a <strong>forward pass</strong> through the network diagram (from start to finish). The LS and LF times are calculated by a <strong>backward pass</strong> (from finish to start).</p>\n",

      ],
      "explanation": "Float can be calculated in two ways. Using start times: Float = $LS - ES = 8 - 5 = 3$ days. Or, using finish times: Early Finish $EF = ES + Duration = 5 + 3 = 8$ days. Late Finish $LF = LS + Duration = 8 + 3 = 11$ days. Float = $LF - EF = 11 - 8 = 3$ days."
