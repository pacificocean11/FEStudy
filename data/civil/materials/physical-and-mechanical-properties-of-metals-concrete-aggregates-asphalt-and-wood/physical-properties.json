Density and Unit Weight</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Density ($\\rho$)</strong> is the mass per unit volume, while <strong>Unit Weight ($\\gamma$)</strong> is the weight per unit volume. These are fundamental physical properties for all civil engineering materials.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Steel:</strong> High density, typically around 490 lb/ft³ (7850 kg/m³).</li>\n    <li><strong>Concrete:</strong> Normal weight concrete is typically around 145-150 lb/ft³ (2300-2400 kg/m³).</li>\n    <li><strong>Wood:</strong> Varies significantly by species and moisture content. Typically 20-50 lb/ft³.</li>\n    <li><strong>Aggregates:</strong> Varies by rock type, typically 90-110 lb/ft³ loose, higher when compacted.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Porosity and Absorption</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">These properties relate to the voids within a material.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Porosity ($n$):</strong> The ratio of the volume of voids to the total volume. It affects permeability and strength.</li>\n    <li><strong>Absorption:</strong> The ability of a material to absorb water. It is crucial for aggregates in concrete mix design (to adjust water-cement ratio) and for durability (freeze-thaw resistance). High absorption aggregates can absorb mixing water, reducing workability.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Moisture Content (Wood)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For wood, moisture content (MC) is a critical physical property defined as the weight of water relative to the oven-dry weight of the wood. Wood is <strong>hygroscopic</strong>, meaning it absorbs and releases moisture from the air. Changes in MC cause wood to shrink (when drying) or swell (when wetting), which can lead to warping and cracking. It also significantly affects strength.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Thermal Expansion</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">All materials expand and contract with temperature changes. The <strong>Coefficient of Thermal Expansion ($\\alpha$)</strong> quantifies this.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Concrete and Steel:</strong> Conveniently, concrete and steel have very similar coefficients of thermal expansion ($\\approx 6 \\times 10^{-6} / °F$ or $11 \\times 10^{-6} / °C$). This compatibility allows them to work together in reinforced concrete without destroying the bond during temperature changes.</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "question": "Why is the absorption capacity of aggregates important in concrete mix design?",

        { "text": "It determines the color of the concrete.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "It affects the amount of mixing water available for hydration.", "isCorrect": true },

        { "text": "It determines the setting time of the cement.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Dry aggregates will absorb some of the mixing water, effectively lowering the water-cement ratio and reducing workability. Saturated surface-dry (SSD) aggregates neither absorb nor add water. Wet aggregates contribute free moisture, increasing the w/c ratio. The mix design must account for this to ensure the target strength and workability."

      "question": "Which property of wood is responsible for its dimensional instability (shrinking and swelling) with changing humidity?",

        { "text": "Density", "isCorrect": false },

        { "text": "Conductivity", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Wood is hygroscopic, meaning it naturally exchanges moisture with the surrounding air to reach equilibrium. As it gains or loses moisture below the fiber saturation point (approx. 30% MC), the cell walls expand or contract, changing the dimensions of the wood."
