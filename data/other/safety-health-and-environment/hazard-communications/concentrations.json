Exposure Limits</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">To protect workers from the health effects of exposure to hazardous substances, regulatory bodies and health organizations establish exposure limits. These are the maximum concentrations of airborne contaminants to which a worker can be exposed during a specified period.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">PELs are legal limits enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>PEL-TWA (Time-Weighted Average):</strong> The average exposure over an 8-hour workday. A worker's exposure can be higher than the TWA at times, as long as it is compensated by periods of lower exposure.</li>\n    <li><strong>PEL-STEL (Short-Term Exposure Limit):</strong> A concentration to which workers can be exposed continuously for a short period (usually 15 minutes) without suffering adverse effects.</li>\n    <li><strong>PEL-C (Ceiling):</strong> A concentration that must not be exceeded at any time during the workday.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. ACGIH Threshold Limit Values (TLVs)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">TLVs are recommendations from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). While not legal standards like PELs, they are widely respected and often more up-to-date.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The categories (TLV-TWA, TLV-STEL, TLV-C) are analogous to OSHA's PELs.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Units</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Concentrations are typically measured in:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Parts per million (ppm):</strong> For gases and vapors.</li>\n    <li><strong>Milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m³):</strong> For dusts, fumes, and mists.</li>\n</ul>\n",

        { "text": "The maximum concentration a worker can be exposed to at any time.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "The average concentration a worker can be exposed to over an 8-hour workday.", "isCorrect": true },

        { "text": "The average concentration a worker can be exposed to for a 15-minute period.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The PEL-TWA is the time-weighted average concentration for a conventional 8-hour workday and a 40-hour workweek, to which it is believed that nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed, day after day, without adverse effect."

      ],
      "explanation": "A Ceiling limit is an absolute maximum concentration that should never be exceeded. It is different from a TWA, which is an average over 8 hours, and a STEL, which is an average over 15 minutes."
