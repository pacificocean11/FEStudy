Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>Safety Data Sheet (SDS)</strong>, formerly known as a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), is a standardized document that contains information about the potential hazards (health, fire, reactivity, and environmental) of a chemical product and how to work safely with it.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. OSHA's 16-Section Format</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">As required by the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (HCS), an SDS must follow a uniform 16-section format to ensure consistency and ease of use. Key sections for workplace safety include:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Section 1: Identification:</strong> Includes product identifier, manufacturer or distributor name, address, phone number, and emergency phone number.</li>\n    <li><strong>Section 2: Hazard(s) Identification:</strong> Includes all hazards regarding the chemical; required label elements such as pictograms, signal words, and hazard statements.</li>\n    <li><strong>Section 4: First-Aid Measures:</strong> Describes the initial care that should be given by untrained responders to an individual who has been exposed to the chemical.</li>\n    <li><strong>Section 7: Handling and Storage:</strong> Lists precautions for safe handling and storage, including incompatibilities.</li>\n    <li><strong>Section 8: Exposure Controls / Personal Protection:</strong> Lists OSHA's Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs), ACGIH Threshold Limit Values (TLVs), and specifies the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).</li>\n</ul>\n",
