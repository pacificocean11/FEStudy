Labels provide a quick, immediate warning and essential information about the hazards of a chemical.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. GHS Label Elements</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">OSHA requires that labels on shipped containers for hazardous chemicals include the following six elements, aligned with the Globally Harmonized System (GHS):</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Product Identifier:</strong> The name or number used for a hazardous chemical on a label or in the SDS.</li>\n    <li><strong>Signal Word:</strong> Used to indicate the relative level of severity of the hazard. \"<strong>Danger</strong>\" is used for more severe hazards, while \"<strong>Warning</strong>\" is used for less severe hazards.</li>\n    <li><strong>Hazard Statement(s):</strong> A standardized phrase assigned to a hazard class and category that describes the nature of the hazard(s) of a chemical (e.g., \"Causes serious eye damage\").</li>\n    <li><strong>Precautionary Statement(s):</strong> A phrase that describes recommended measures to be taken to minimize or prevent adverse effects resulting from exposure to a hazardous chemical.</li>\n    <li><strong>Pictogram(s):</strong> A symbol on a white background with a red border that is intended to convey specific information about the hazards of a chemical. There are nine GHS pictograms.</li>\n    <li><strong>Supplier Identification:</strong> The name, address, and telephone number of the chemical manufacturer, importer, or other responsible party.</li>\n</ul>\n",
