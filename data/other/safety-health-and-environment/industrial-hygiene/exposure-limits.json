Purpose</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">To protect workers from the health effects of exposure to hazardous substances, regulatory bodies and health organizations establish exposure limits. These are the maximum concentrations of airborne contaminants to which a worker can be exposed during a specified period without expecting to suffer adverse effects.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">PELs are legal limits enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>PEL-TWA (Time-Weighted Average):</strong> The average exposure over an 8-hour workday. A worker's exposure can be higher than the TWA at times, as long as it is compensated by periods of lower exposure.</li>\n    <li><strong>PEL-STEL (Short-Term Exposure Limit):</strong> A concentration to which workers can be exposed continuously for a short period (usually 15 minutes) without suffering adverse effects.</li>\n    <li><strong>PEL-C (Ceiling):</strong> A concentration that must not be exceeded at any time during the workday.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. ACGIH Threshold Limit Values (TLVs)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">TLVs are recommendations from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). While not legal standards like PELs, they are widely respected and often more up-to-date. The categories (TLV-TWA, TLV-STEL, TLV-C) are analogous to OSHA's PELs.</p>\n",
