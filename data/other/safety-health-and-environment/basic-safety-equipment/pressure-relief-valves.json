Purpose</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>pressure relief valve (PRV)</strong> is a type of safety valve used to protect a pressure vessel, piping system, or other equipment from an overpressure event. It is designed to automatically open at a predetermined pressure (the setpoint) and discharge fluid to relieve the excess pressure, then close again when the pressure returns to a safe level.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Types</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Relief Valve:</strong> Typically used for liquids. It opens in proportion to the increase in pressure over the opening pressure.</li>\n    <li><strong>Safety Valve:</strong> Typically used for compressible fluids like steam or gases. It is designed to open rapidly and fully ('pop open') when the set pressure is reached.</li>\n    <li><strong>Pressure Safety Valve (PSV):</strong> A generic term that can refer to either a relief valve or a safety valve.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Operation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Most PRVs are spring-loaded. The system pressure acts on a disc, pushing against the force of a compressed spring. When the system pressure force exceeds the spring force, the disc lifts off its seat, allowing fluid to escape. When the pressure drops, the spring forces the disc back onto its seat, resealing the system.</p>\n",
