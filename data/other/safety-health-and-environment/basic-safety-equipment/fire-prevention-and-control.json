Removing any one of these elements will extinguish the fire.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Fuel:</strong> Any combustible material (solid, liquid, or gas).</li>\n    <li><strong>Heat:</strong> An ignition source to raise the fuel to its ignition temperature.</li>\n    <li><strong>Oxygen:</strong> The oxidizer, usually from the air.</li>\n    <li><strong>Chemical Chain Reaction:</strong> The self-sustaining process of combustion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Classes of Fire</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Fires are classified based on the type of fuel that is burning. This is important for selecting the correct type of fire extinguisher.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Class A:</strong> Ordinary combustibles like wood, paper, cloth, and plastics.</li>\n    <li><strong>Class B:</strong> Flammable liquids like gasoline, oil, and grease, and flammable gases.</li>\n    <li><strong>Class C:</strong> Energized electrical equipment.</li>\n    <li><strong>Class D:</strong> Combustible metals like magnesium, titanium, and sodium.</li>\n    <li><strong>Class K:</strong> Cooking oils and fats in commercial cooking equipment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Types of Fire Extinguishers</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Water (APW):</strong> For Class A fires only. Cools the fuel.</li>\n    <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):</strong> For Class B and C fires. Displaces oxygen and cools the fuel.</li>\n    <li><strong>Dry Chemical (ABC or BC):</strong> Multipurpose (ABC) extinguishers are effective on Class A, B, and C fires. They work by interrupting the chemical chain reaction.</li>\n    <li><strong>Wet Chemical:</strong> For Class K fires. Forms a soap-like barrier to prevent re-ignition.</li>\n    <li><strong>Dry Powder:</strong> For Class D fires only. Smothers the fire.</li>\n</ul>\n",
