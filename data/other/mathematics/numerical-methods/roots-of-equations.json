  "notes": "\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">1. Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>root</strong> (or zero) of a function $f(x)$ is a value of $x$ for which $f(x) = 0$. Graphically, this corresponds to the x-intercept of the function.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Newton-Raphson Method</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Newton's method is a powerful iterative technique for finding approximations to the roots of a real-valued function. It requires an initial guess $x_0$. The formula for the next approximation is:</p>\n$$ x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This method converges very quickly (quadratically) if the initial guess is close enough to the root, but it requires the derivative of the function.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Bisection Method</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The Bisection method is a simpler, robust bracketing method. It starts with two points $a$ and $b$ such that $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs (meaning a root exists between them). At each step, the interval is halved. If the midpoint has the same sign as $a$, the new interval becomes $[midpoint, b]$, otherwise $[a, midpoint]$. It converges slowly but is guaranteed to find a root.</p>\n",
