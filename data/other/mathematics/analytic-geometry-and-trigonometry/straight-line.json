Forms of the Equation of a Straight Line</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The relationship between the x and y coordinates of any point on a line can be expressed by an equation. Several forms are common:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Slope-Intercept Form:</strong> The most common form, expressed as $y = mx + b$.\n        <ul class=\"list-circle list-inside ml-6\">\n            <li>$m$ is the slope of the line.</li>\n            <li>$b$ is the y-intercept, the point where the line crosses the y-axis, i.e., $(0, b)$.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Point-Slope Form:</strong> Used when you know the slope $m$ and a single point $(x_1, y_1)$ on the line. The equation is $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Two-Point Form:</strong> Used when you know two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ on the line. The equation is derived from the point-slope form by first calculating the slope: $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. The equation is $(y - y_1) = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)$.</li>\n    <li><strong>General Form:</strong> Expressed as $Ax + By + C = 0$, where A, B, and C are constants. The slope is $m = -A/B$ and the y-intercept is $b = -C/B$.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Parallel and Perpendicular Lines</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The relationship between the slopes of two lines, $m_1$ and $m_2$, determines if they are parallel or perpendicular.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Parallel Lines:</strong> Two non-vertical lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal. $$m_1 = m_2$$</li>\n    <li><strong>Perpendicular Lines:</strong> Two lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is -1. This means one slope is the negative reciprocal of the other. $$m_1 \\cdot m_2 = -1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad m_2 = -\\frac{1}{m_1}$$</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Distance Formulas</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Distance Between Two Points:</strong> The distance $d$ between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the Pythagorean theorem: $$d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$</li>\n    <li><strong>Shortest Distance from a Point to a Line:</strong> The shortest distance from a point $(x_0, y_0)$ to a line given by the general equation $Ax + By + C = 0$ is: $$d = \\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}$$</li>\n</ul>\n                ",

      "explanation": "First, calculate the slope ($m$) using the two points: $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{11 - 5}{4 - 2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$. Next, use the point-slope form $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$ with the point $(2, 5)$ and the slope $m=3$. This gives $y - 5 = 3(x - 2)$, which simplifies to $y - 5 = 3x - 6$. Adding 5 to both sides gives the final equation in slope-intercept form: $y = 3x - 1$."

      "explanation": "Parallel lines have the same slope. The slope of the given line $y = -2x + 5$ is $m = -2$. Use the point-slope form $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$ with the point $(3, 4)$ and slope $m=-2$. This gives $y - 4 = -2(x - 3)$, which simplifies to $y - 4 = -2x + 6$.
