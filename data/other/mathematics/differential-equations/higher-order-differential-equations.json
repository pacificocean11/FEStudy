  "notes": "\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">1. Homogeneous Linear DEs with Constant Coefficients</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This type of DE has the form: </p>\n$$ay'' + by' + cy = 0$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">To solve it, we assume a solution of the form $y = e^{rx}$ and substitute it into the equation. This leads to the <strong>characteristic (or auxiliary) equation</strong>:</p>\n$$ar^2 + br + c = 0$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The general solution depends on the roots of this quadratic equation:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Case 1: Two distinct real roots, $r_1$ and $r_2$.</strong> The general solution is $y = C_1e^{r_1x} + C_2e^{r_2x}$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Case 2: One repeated real root, $r$.</strong> The general solution is $y = C_1e^{rx} + C_2xe^{rx}$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Case 3: Two complex conjugate roots, $r = \\alpha \\pm i\\beta$.</strong> The general solution is $y = e^{\\alpha x}(C_1\\cos(\\beta x) + C_2\\sin(\\beta x))$.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Nonhomogeneous Linear DEs</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For an equation like $ay'' + by' + cy = G(x)$, the general solution is the sum of the complementary solution ($y_c$) and a particular solution ($y_p$):</p>\n$$y(x) = y_c(x) + y_p(x)$$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$y_c$ is the general solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation ($ay'' + by' + cy = 0$).</li>\n    <li>$y_p$ is any particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. It is often found using the <strong>Method of Undetermined Coefficients</strong>, where you make an educated guess for the form of $y_p$ based on the form of $G(x)$.</li>\n</ul>\n              ",
