Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Combined loading occurs when a structural member is subjected to multiple types of loads simultaneously, such as an axial force and a bending moment. The <strong>Principle of Superposition</strong> states that if the material remains linear elastic and deformations are small, the total stress at any point is the algebraic sum of the stresses caused by each load acting individually.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Axial Load with Bending</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Consider a member subjected to an axial force ($P$) and a bending moment ($M$). The total normal stress ($\\sigma$) at any distance $y$ from the neutral axis is:</p>\n$$ \\sigma = \\sigma_{axial} + \\sigma_{bending} = \\pm \\frac{P}{A} \\pm \\frac{My}{I} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$\\frac{P}{A}$: Uniform axial stress (positive for tension, negative for compression).</li>\n    <li>$\\frac{My}{I}$: Linearly varying bending stress (tension on one side of the neutral axis, compression on the other).</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The maximum stress occurs at the outer fibers where the axial and bending stresses add up (same sign).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Eccentric Axial Loading</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A common case of combined loading is an eccentric axial load. If an axial load $P$ is applied at a distance $e$ (eccentricity) from the centroidal axis, it is equivalent to a centroidal axial load $P$ plus a bending moment $M = Pe$.</p>\n$$ \\sigma = \\pm \\frac{P}{A} \\pm \\frac{(Pe)y}{I} $$\n",
