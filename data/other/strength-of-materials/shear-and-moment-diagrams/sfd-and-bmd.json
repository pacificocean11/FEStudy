Concepts</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Shear Force Diagrams (SFD)</strong> and <strong>Bending Moment Diagrams (BMD)</strong> are graphical representations of the internal shear force ($V$) and bending moment ($M$) at all points along the length of a beam.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Shear Force ($V$):</strong> The sum of all vertical forces acting on the beam to the left (or right) of a section. It tends to slide adjacent layers of the beam vertically.</li>\n    <li><strong>Bending Moment ($M$):</strong> The sum of all moments (including those from forces) acting on the beam to the left (or right) of a section. It tends to bend the beam.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Sign Convention</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The standard sign convention for internal forces is:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Positive Shear (+V):</strong> Upward on the left face, downward on the right face.</li>\n    <li><strong>Positive Moment (+M):</strong> Compresses the top fibers and elongates the bottom fibers (makes the beam 'smile').</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Differential Relationships</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">There are fundamental mathematical relationships between the distributed load ($w(x)$), shear ($V(x)$), and moment ($M(x)$):</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>The slope of the shear diagram is equal to the negative of the distributed load intensity.\n    $$ \\frac{dV}{dx} = -w(x) $$\n    So, the change in shear between two points is the area under the load curve (negative).\n    $$ \\Delta V = -\\int w(x) dx $$</li>\n    <li>The slope of the moment diagram is equal to the shear force.\n    $$ \\frac{dM}{dx} = V(x) $$\n    So, the change in moment between two points is the area under the shear curve.\n    $$ \\Delta M = \\int V(x) dx $$</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Maximum and minimum moments occur where the shear force is zero (since $dM/dx = V = 0$).</p>\n",

      "explanation": "The slope of the moment diagram is equal to the shear force ($dM/dx = V$). If V is a positive constant, then the slope of M is a positive constant, which describes a straight line sloping upwards."
