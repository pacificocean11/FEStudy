Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Allowable stress</strong>, also known as the design stress, is the maximum stress that a material or component is designed to withstand during normal service. It is a value determined by the designer to ensure the safety and reliability of a structure.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Calculation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The allowable stress is calculated by taking a relevant material strength property and dividing it by a factor of safety (F.S.).</p>\n$$ \\sigma_{allow} = \\frac{\\text{Material Strength}}{F.S.} $$\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Basis for Calculation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The strength property used depends on the material type and the anticipated mode of failure:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>For <strong>ductile materials</strong> under static loading, the allowable stress is typically based on the <strong>yield strength ($S_y$)</strong>. This ensures the component will not permanently deform.</li>\n    $$ \\sigma_{allow} = \\frac{S_y}{F.S.} $$\n    <li>For <strong>brittle materials</strong> under static loading, the allowable stress is based on the <strong>ultimate tensile strength ($S_{ut}$)</strong>, as these materials do not yield significantly before fracturing.</li>\n    $$ \\sigma_{allow} = \\frac{S_{ut}}{F.S.} $$\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Design Requirement</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Once the allowable stress is determined, the fundamental requirement for a safe design is that the actual stress induced in the component under the most severe loading conditions must be less than or equal to the allowable stress.</p>\n$$ \\sigma_{actual} \\le \\sigma_{allow} $$\n",
