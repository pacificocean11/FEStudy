Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Buckling</strong> is a failure mode characterized by a sudden sideways deflection of a long, slender structural member subjected to a high compressive axial load. This can occur even if the compressive stress is less than the material's yield strength. It is a failure due to instability.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Euler's Column Formula</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>Euler formula</strong> calculates the critical load ($P_{cr}$), which is the maximum axial load that a long, slender, ideal column can carry without buckling.</p>\n$$ P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{(KL)^2} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$P_{cr}$ is the critical buckling load.</li>\n    <li>$E$ is the modulus of elasticity of the material.</li>\n    <li>$I$ is the minimum area moment of inertia of the column's cross-section.</li>\n    <li>$L$ is the unsupported length of the column.</li>\n    <li>$K$ is the column effective length factor, which depends on the end support conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Effective Length Factor (K)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The K-factor accounts for how the column is supported at its ends. Different end conditions change the column's ability to resist buckling.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Pinned-Pinned:</strong> K = 1.0 (The baseline case).</li>\n    <li><strong>Fixed-Fixed:</strong> K = 0.5 (Strongest case).</li>\n    <li><strong>Fixed-Pinned:</strong> K = 0.7.</li>\n    <li><strong>Fixed-Free (Cantilever):</strong> K = 2.0 (Weakest case).</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "question": "For a slender column, which set of end conditions will result in the highest critical buckling load?",
      "options": [
        { "text": "Pinned at both ends.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Fixed at one end, free at the other.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Fixed at both ends.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "Fixed at one end, pinned at the other.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The critical load is inversely proportional to the square of the effective length factor, K ($P_{cr} \\propto 1/K^2$). The lowest K-factor will give the highest critical load. The fixed-fixed condition has the lowest K-factor (K=0.5), making it the most resistant to buckling."
