Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Fatigue</strong> is a failure mechanism that occurs in materials subjected to repeated or fluctuating (cyclic) stresses. Failure can occur even if the maximum stress in the cycle is well below the material's ultimate tensile strength or yield strength.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Fatigue is a progressive and localized structural damage. It is the most common cause of mechanical failure in engineering components.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. The S-N Curve</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The fatigue behavior of a material is characterized by an <strong>S-N curve</strong> (Stress vs. Number of cycles to failure). The curve is generated by cyclically loading multiple test specimens at different stress amplitudes ($S$) and recording the number of cycles ($N$) it takes for each to fail.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Endurance Limit</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For some materials, notably steels, the S-N curve becomes horizontal at a high number of cycles. The stress level at which this occurs is called the <strong>endurance limit</strong> or fatigue limit. Below this stress level, the material can theoretically endure an infinite number of cycles without failing.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Stages of Fatigue Failure</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Fatigue failure occurs in three stages:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Crack Initiation:</strong> A small crack forms at a point of high stress concentration.</li>\n    <li><strong>Crack Propagation:</strong> With each stress cycle, the crack slowly grows.</li>\n    <li><strong>Final Fracture:</strong> The crack grows large enough that the remaining cross-section can no longer support the load, and it fails suddenly.</li>\n</ol>\n",
