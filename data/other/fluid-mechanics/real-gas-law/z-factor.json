Compressibility Factor ($Z$)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The ideal gas law ($Pv=RT$) is simple but not always accurate, especially at high pressures or low temperatures. To account for the deviation from ideal behavior in real gases, a correction factor called the <strong>compressibility factor ($Z$)</strong> is used.</p>\n$$ Z = \\frac{Pv}{RT} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The modified equation of state for real gases is:</p>\n$$ Pv = ZRT $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>For an ideal gas, $Z = 1$.</li>\n    <li>For real gases, $Z$ can be greater than or less than 1.</li>\n    <li>If $Z < 1$, attractive forces dominate, and the gas is more compressible than an ideal gas.</li>\n    <li>If $Z > 1$, repulsive forces (molecular volume) dominate, and the gas is less compressible than an ideal gas.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Principle of Corresponding States</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The compressibility factor $Z$ is approximately the same for all gases when they are at the same <strong>reduced temperature ($T_r$)</strong> and <strong>reduced pressure ($P_r$)</strong>.</p>\n$$ P_r = \\frac{P}{P_{cr}} \\quad \\quad T_r = \\frac{T}{T_{cr}} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">where $P_{cr}$ and $T_{cr}$ are the critical pressure and critical temperature of the specific gas (found in property tables). This principle allows the use of a single <strong>Generalized Compressibility Chart</strong> to find $Z$ for any gas.</p>\n",

      "explanation": "As pressure approaches zero (or as specific volume approaches infinity), the distance between molecules increases, making intermolecular forces negligible. Under these conditions, all real gases behave like ideal gases, and $Z$ approaches 1."
