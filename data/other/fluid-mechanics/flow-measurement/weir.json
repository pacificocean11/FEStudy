Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>weir</strong> is an overflow structure built across an open channel (like a river or canal) to measure the volumetric flow rate of water. The water level upstream of the weir (the head, $H$) is related to the flow rate ($Q$).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Rectangular Weir</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A rectangular weir has a horizontal crest. The flow rate is typically given by:</p>\n$$ Q = C L H^{1.5} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$Q$: Flow rate.</li>\n    <li>$C$: Weir coefficient (depends on geometry and units).</li>\n    <li>$L$: Length of the weir crest.</li>\n    <li>$H$: Head (height) of water above the crest, measured upstream.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Triangular (V-Notch) Weir</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A V-notch weir has a V-shaped opening. It is better suited for measuring low flow rates because the head $H$ is more sensitive to changes in flow. The flow rate is proportional to $H^{2.5}$:</p>\n$$ Q = C H^{2.5} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For a 90-degree V-notch weir, the formula is often simplified.</p>\n",
