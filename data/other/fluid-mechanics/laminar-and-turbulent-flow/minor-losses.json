They cause energy dissipation due to flow separation and turbulence.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The head loss is calculated using a loss coefficient, $K$:</p>\n$$ h_L = K \\frac{v^2}{2g} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Values for $K$ are determined experimentally. A higher $K$ value means more flow resistance.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Valve Types</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Gate Valve:</strong> Designed for on/off control. Low $K$ when fully open (minimal obstruction).</li>\n    <li><strong>Globe Valve:</strong> Designed for throttling/regulating flow. High $K$ due to complex flow path.</li>\n    <li><strong>Ball Valve:</strong> Quarter-turn valve. Very low $K$ when fully open.</li>\n    <li><strong>Check Valve:</strong> Allows flow in only one direction.</li>\n</ul>\n",
