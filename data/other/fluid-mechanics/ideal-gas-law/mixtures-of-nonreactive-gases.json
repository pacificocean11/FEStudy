Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Dalton's Law states that for a mixture of ideal gases, the total pressure exerted by the mixture is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of individual component gases.</p>\n$$ P_{total} = \\sum P_i = P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_n $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The partial pressure ($P_i$) is the pressure a component would exert if it occupied the entire volume alone at the mixture temperature.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Amagat's Law of Partial Volumes</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Amagat's Law states that the total volume of a gas mixture is equal to the sum of the partial volumes of the individual components.</p>\n$$ V_{total} = \\sum V_i $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The partial volume ($V_i$) is the volume a component would occupy if it were alone at the mixture temperature and total pressure.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3.

      "explanation": "According to Dalton's Law, the partial pressure of a component is equal to its mole fraction multiplied by the total pressure. $P_{He} = y_{He} \\times P_{total} = 0.3 \\times 500 \\text{ kPa} = 150$ kPa."
