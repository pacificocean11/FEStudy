Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>radius of gyration ($k$)</strong> is a geometric property that describes how the area of a cross-section is distributed around an axis. It represents the distance from the axis at which the entire area could be concentrated into a thin strip and still yield the same moment of inertia as the original shape.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Formula</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The radius of gyration is derived from the relationship $I = k^2 A$. Rearranging for $k$:</p>\n$$ k = \\sqrt{\\frac{I}{A}} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$k_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{I_x}{A}}$ (about the x-axis)</li>\n    <li>$k_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{I_y}{A}}$ (about the y-axis)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">It has units of length (e.g., inches, mm, meters).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Application</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The radius of gyration is a critical parameter in the design of columns. It is used to calculate the <strong>slenderness ratio ($L/k$)</strong>, which determines a column's susceptibility to buckling. A column will buckle about the axis with the <strong>minimum</strong> radius of gyration ($k_{min}$).</p>\n",

      "explanation": "First find Area $A = 4 \\times 4 = 16$ in². Then find Inertia $I = bh^3/12 = 4(4)^3/12 = 256/12 = 21.33$ in⁴. Radius of gyration $k = \\sqrt{I/A} = \\sqrt{21.33/16} = \\sqrt{1.333} \\approx 1.15$ in. Alternatively for a rectangle, $k = h/\\sqrt{12} = 4/3.464 \\approx 1.15$ in."

      "explanation": "Buckling occurs about the 'weak' axis, which is the axis with the least resistance to bending. This corresponds to the minimum moment of inertia and, consequently, the minimum radius of gyration ($k_{min}$)."
