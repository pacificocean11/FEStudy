Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>Product of Inertia ($I_{xy}$)</strong> is a geometric property of a cross-section that measures its asymmetry with respect to the x and y axes. Unlike the area moments of inertia ($I_x, I_y$), which are always positive, the product of inertia can be positive, negative, or zero.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The product of inertia is defined by the integral:</p>\n$$ I_{xy} = \\int_A xy \\ dA $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">It has units of length to the fourth power (e.g., in⁴ or m⁴).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Symmetry Property</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">If an area has <strong>at least one axis of symmetry</strong>, the product of inertia $I_{xy}$ with respect to any set of axes that includes the axis of symmetry is <strong>zero</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For example, for a rectangle, circle, I-beam, or T-beam, the product of inertia about the centroidal axes is zero.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Principal Axes</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For any area, there exists a set of perpendicular axes (rotated by some angle $\\theta_p$) about which the product of inertia is zero ($I_{xy} = 0$). These are called the <strong>Principal Axes</strong>. About these axes, the area moments of inertia ($I_u, I_v$) are at their maximum and minimum values.</p>\n",
