Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>Perpendicular Axis Theorem</strong> relates the polar moment of inertia of a planar lamina (a 2D shape) about an axis perpendicular to its plane to the area moments of inertia about two perpendicular axes lying within its plane.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. The Theorem</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For any planar area lying in the x-y plane, the polar moment of inertia ($J_z$) about the z-axis (perpendicular to the plane and passing through the origin) is equal to the sum of the area moments of inertia about the x and y axes.</p>\n$$ J_z = I_x + I_y $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This theorem assumes that the axes x, y, and z are mutually perpendicular and intersect at a common origin.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Application</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This theorem provides a convenient way to calculate the polar moment of inertia if the area moments of inertia are known, or vice versa. It applies only to flat, 2D areas or laminas, not to 3D bodies.</p>\n",
