This requires both the net force and the net moment on the body to be zero.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>Vector Equations: $\\sum \\mathbf{F} = 0$ and $\\sum \\mathbf{M}_O = 0$ (about any point O).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Scalar Equations (2D)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For coplanar force systems (2D), the vector conditions reduce to three scalar equations:</p>\n$$ \\sum F_x = 0, \\quad \\sum F_y = 0, \\quad \\sum M_O = 0 $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">These three independent equations can solve for up to three unknowns (e.g., support reactions).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Support Reactions (2D)</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Roller / Rocker:</strong> 1 unknown (Force perpendicular to surface). Resists translation in one direction only.</li>\n    <li><strong>Pin / Hinge:</strong> 2 unknowns (Force components $R_x, R_y$). Resists translation in any direction.</li>\n    <li><strong>Fixed Support:</strong> 3 unknowns ($R_x, R_y, M$). Resists translation and rotation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Stability and Determinacy</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Statically Determinate:</strong> Number of unknowns = Number of equilibrium equations (3 in 2D).</li>\n    <li><strong>Statically Indeterminate:</strong> Number of unknowns > Number of equations. Cannot be solved by statics alone.</li>\n    <li><strong>Unstable:</strong> Number of unknowns < Number of equations, or improper constraints (e.g., all reactions are parallel or concurrent).</li>\n</ul>\n",
