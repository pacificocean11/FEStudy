  "notes": "\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">1. Importance</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>Free-Body Diagram (FBD)</strong> is the most important tool in mechanics. It is a sketch of the body of interest, isolated from its surroundings (hence \"free\"), showing all the external forces and moments acting on it.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Steps to Draw an FBD</h3>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Isolate the Body:</strong> Draw the outline of the body. Remove all supports and contacting bodies.</li>\n    <li><strong>Apply Active Forces:</strong> Draw vectors for all known external loads (gravity/weight, applied pushes/pulls). Weight acts through the center of gravity.</li>\n    <li><strong>Apply Reactive Forces:</strong> Replace supports and contacts with the appropriate reaction forces. (e.g., a cable becomes a tension force, a floor becomes a normal force and friction force).</li>\n    <li><strong>Label and Dimension:</strong> Add magnitudes, directions/angles, and relevant dimensions. Define a coordinate system (x, y).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Common Mistakes</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>Including internal forces (forces that parts of the body exert on each other).</li>\n    <li>Including forces exerted *by* the body on the surroundings (Newton's 3rd Law). Only forces *on* the body belong on the FBD.</li>\n    <li>Forgetting weight.</li>\n    <li>Incorrect support reactions (e.g., adding a moment at a pin support).</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "explanation": "A frictionless surface can only exert a normal force (perpendicular to the surface). Since the wall is vertical, the normal force is horizontal."
