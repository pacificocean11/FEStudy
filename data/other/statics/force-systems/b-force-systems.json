Classification of Force Systems</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Coplanar:</strong> Lines of action of all forces lie in the same plane.</li>\n    <li><strong>Concurrent:</strong> Lines of action of all forces pass through a single common point.</li>\n    <li><strong>Parallel:</strong> Lines of action of all forces are parallel.</li>\n    <li><strong>Collinear:</strong> Forces act along the same line.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Resolution of Forces</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A single force can be replaced by its components. In 2D:</p>\n$$ F_x = F \\cos \\theta $$\n$$ F_y = F \\sin \\theta $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">where $\\theta$ is the angle measured from the x-axis.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Resultant of a Force System</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The resultant of a system of concurrent forces is the vector sum of the individual forces. It has the same external effect on the rigid body as the original system.</p>\n$$ R_x = \\sum F_x, \\quad R_y = \\sum F_y $$\n$$ R = \\sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2} $$\n$$ \\theta_R = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{R_y}{R_x}\\right) $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For non-concurrent systems, the resultant may be a single force, a couple, or a force and a couple.</p>\n",
