      "explanation": "The normal force $N = mg = 50 \\times 9.81 = 490.5$ N. The force required to start motion must overcome the maximum static friction: $F = f_{s,max} = \\mu_s N = 0.4 \\times 490.5 = 196.2$ N."

      "explanation": "On an incline, impending motion occurs when the component of weight down the slope equals maximum static friction. This geometric condition reduces to $\\tan \\theta = \\mu_s$.

      "explanation": "Since the applied force (100 N) is less than the maximum static friction (150 N), the block is in equilibrium. From $\\sum F_x = 0$, the friction force must exactly balance the applied force. So $f_s = 100$ N."
