Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Life-Cycle Analysis (LCA)</strong>, also known as Life-Cycle Assessment, is a technique to assess the environmental impacts associated with all the stages of a product's life from raw material extraction through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling (Cradle-to-Grave).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. The Four Phases of LCA</h3>\n<ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Goal and Scope Definition:</strong> Defining the product system, system boundaries, and the purpose of the study.</li>\n    <li><strong>Inventory Analysis (LCI):</strong> Compiling a list of inputs (energy, raw materials) and outputs (emissions, waste) for all processes in the life cycle.</li>\n    <li><strong>Impact Assessment (LCIA):</strong> Evaluating the significance of potential environmental impacts based on the inventory results (e.g., global warming potential, toxicity, acidification).</li>\n    <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Summarizing the results to make decisions and recommendations.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Importance</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">LCA prevents \"problem shifting\"—for example, creating a product that is energy-efficient during use but creates massive toxic waste during manufacturing. It provides a holistic view of environmental impact.</p>\n",
