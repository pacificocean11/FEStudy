The Paramount Obligation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The first Fundamental Canon of the NSPE Code of Ethics states: \"Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.\" This obligation overrides duties to clients or employers.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Risk Management and Safety Factors</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Engineers ensure public safety through:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Factors of Safety:</strong> Designing structures to withstand loads significantly higher than expected service loads.</li>\n    <li><strong>Redundancy:</strong> Designing systems so that if one component fails, others can take over (fail-safe design).</li>\n    <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Strictly adhering to building codes and standards (e.g., ASME, IEEE, IBC).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Informed Consent</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Engineers must inform the public and clients of the risks associated with engineering projects. If a client overrules an engineer's judgment in a way that endangers public safety, the engineer is ethically obligated to warn the client and, if necessary, report the situation to appropriate authorities.</p>\n",

      "question": "An engineer identifies a design flaw that poses a significant risk to public safety, but fixing it will delay the project and cost the client money. The client insists on proceeding with the original design. What is the engineer's ethical obligation?",

        { "text": "Follow the client's instructions as they are paying for the project.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Document the flaw to protect themselves from liability but proceed.", "isCorrect": false },

        { "text": "Quit the project quietly.", "isCorrect": false }

      "explanation": "Fail-safe design acknowledges that failure can happen but ensures the consequences are mitigated. For example, a train's air brakes are applied if pressure is lost, stopping the train rather than letting it run away."
