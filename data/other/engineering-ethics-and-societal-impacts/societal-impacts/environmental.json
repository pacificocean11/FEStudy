Key Environmental Issues</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> The release of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) like CO2 and Methane. Engineers work on decarbonization and energy efficiency.</li>\n    <li><strong>Air Pollution:</strong> Emission of particulates, NOx, SOx, and VOCs.</li>\n    <li><strong>Water Pollution:</strong> Contamination of water bodies by industrial effluents, agricultural runoff, and sewage.</li>\n    <li><strong>Resource Depletion:</strong> Consuming finite resources (minerals, fossil fuels) faster than they can be replenished.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Regulatory Framework</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In the US, key laws include:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act):</strong> Requires federal agencies to assess environmental effects of proposed actions (Environmental Impact Statements).</li>\n    <li><strong>Clean Air Act & Clean Water Act:</strong> Regulate emissions and discharges.</li>\n    <li><strong>CERCLA (Superfund):</strong> Deals with the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.</li>\n</ul>\n",
