Engineers must evaluate projects not just on technical feasibility, but on economic viability and their broader impact on the economy.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Direct vs. Indirect Costs and Benefits</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Direct Costs:</strong> Materials, labor, land acquisition, operation, and maintenance.</li>\n    <li><strong>Direct Benefits:</strong> Revenue generation, reduced travel time, energy savings.</li>\n    <li><strong>Indirect (External) Costs:</strong> Pollution, traffic congestion during construction, noise, disruption to local businesses.</li>\n    <li><strong>Indirect (External) Benefits:</strong> Increased property values, job creation in supporting industries, improved public health.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Cost-Benefit Analysis</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives. It is used to determine if a project is worthwhile ($B/C > 1$). Ethical considerations involve accurately valuing non-monetary factors (like safety or environmental quality) and not ignoring negative externalities.</p>\n",
