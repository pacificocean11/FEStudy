Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Sustainable development</strong> is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is about finding a balance between environmental protection, social equity, and economic viability.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. The Three Pillars of Sustainability</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Sustainability is often represented as having three interconnected dimensions or pillars:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Environmental Sustainability:</strong> The ability to maintain rates of renewable resource harvest, pollution creation, and non-renewable resource depletion that can be continued indefinitely. It involves protecting ecosystems and biodiversity.</li>\n    <li><strong>Social Sustainability:</strong> The ability of a social system, such as a community, to function at a defined level of social well-being indefinitely. It includes issues of equity, public health, community development, and human rights.</li>\n    <li><strong>Economic Sustainability:</strong> The ability to support a defined level of economic production indefinitely. A sustainable economy must be able to produce goods and services on a continuing basis, to maintain manageable levels of government and external debt, and to avoid extreme sectoral imbalances which damage agricultural or industrial production.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">True sustainability is achieved when all three pillars are in balance.</p>\n",
