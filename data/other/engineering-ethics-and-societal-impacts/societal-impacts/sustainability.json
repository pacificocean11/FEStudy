Definition of Sustainability</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The most widely accepted definition is from the Brundtland Report (1987): \"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\"</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. The Triple Bottom Line</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Sustainability is often evaluated using the \"Triple Bottom Line\" framework, balancing three pillars:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Environmental (Planet):</strong> Minimizing waste, reducing pollution, conserving resources, and protecting ecosystems.</li>\n    <li><strong>Social (People):</strong> Ensuring fair labor practices, community engagement, health and safety, and social equity.</li>\n    <li><strong>Economic (Profit):</strong> Creating economic value and ensuring financial viability without harming the other two pillars.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Sustainable Engineering Principles</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>Use of renewable energy and materials.</li>\n    <li>Designing for durability and reuse (Circular Economy).</li>\n    <li>Minimizing energy and material consumption (Efficiency).</li>\n    <li>Preventing pollution at the source rather than treating it afterwards.</li>\n</ul>\n",
