Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">An isothermal process is a thermodynamic process in which the temperature of the system remains constant: $\\Delta T = 0$.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Internal Energy</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For an <strong>ideal gas</strong>, internal energy ($U$) is a function of temperature only. Therefore, in an isothermal process involving an ideal gas, the change in internal energy is zero.</p>\n$$\\Delta U = 0$$\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. First Law and Work Done</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The first law is $\\Delta U = Q - W$. Since $\\Delta U = 0$ for an ideal gas, it simplifies to:</p>\n$$Q = W$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This means all the heat added to the system is converted into work done by the system. For an ideal gas, $P = \\frac{nRT}{V}$. The work done is:</p>\n$$W = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P dV = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\frac{nRT}{V} dV = nRT \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right)$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Since $P_1V_1 = P_2V_2$ for an isothermal process, we can also write: $W = nRT \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)$.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. P-V Diagram</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">On a Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram, an isothermal process for an ideal gas follows a hyperbolic curve, described by the equation $PV = \\text{constant}$.</p>\n",
