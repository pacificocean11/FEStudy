Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">An <strong>open system</strong> (or control volume) is a thermodynamic system where both mass and energy can cross the boundary. This is in contrast to a closed system, where only energy can cross the boundary.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Common examples of open systems include pumps, turbines, nozzles, diffusers, heat exchangers, and pipes.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Conservation of Mass</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For an open system, the principle of conservation of mass states that the rate of change of mass within the control volume is equal to the net rate of mass flow into the system.</p>\n$$ \\frac{dm_{CV}}{dt} = \\sum \\dot{m}_{in} - \\sum \\dot{m}_{out} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For a <strong>steady-flow process</strong> (where conditions within the control volume do not change with time), the mass within the control volume is constant ($dm_{CV}/dt = 0$). Therefore, the total mass entering equals the total mass leaving.</p>\n$$ \\sum \\dot{m}_{in} = \\sum \\dot{m}_{out} $$\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Mass Flow Rate</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The mass flow rate ($\dot{m}$) is calculated as:</p>\n$$ \\dot{m} = \\rho A V = \\frac{AV}{v} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$\\rho$: Density of the fluid.</li>\n    <li>$A$: Cross-sectional area of flow.</li>\n    <li>$V$: Average flow velocity.</li>\n    <li>$v$: Specific volume ($1/\\rho$).</li>\n</ul>\n",
