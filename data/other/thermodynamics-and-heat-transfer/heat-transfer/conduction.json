Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Conduction</strong> is the transfer of heat energy through a material without any motion of the material as a whole. It occurs due to the transfer of kinetic energy between particles (atoms or molecules) through collisions and vibrations.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Fourier's Law of Conduction</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The rate of heat conduction is governed by Fourier's Law:</p>\n$$ q = -kA \\frac{dT}{dx} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$q$: Heat transfer rate (W).</li>\n    <li>$k$: <strong>Thermal Conductivity</strong> (W/m·K). A property of the material indicating how well it conducts heat. Metals generally have high $k$, while insulators have low $k$.</li>\n    <li>$A$: Cross-sectional area perpendicular to heat flow (m²).</li>\n    <li>$dT/dx$: Temperature gradient (K/m).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Steady-State Conduction through a Plane Wall</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For a plane wall of thickness $L$ with constant surface temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$ ($T_1 > T_2$):</p>\n$$ q = \\frac{kA(T_1 - T_2)}{L} = \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{L/kA} = \\frac{\\Delta T}{R_{cond}} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Here, $R_{cond} = L/kA$ is the <strong>thermal resistance</strong> to conduction.</p>\n",
