From a statistical perspective, it is a measure of the number of microscopic configurations that correspond to a thermodynamic system's macroscopic state.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Entropy Change ($\\Delta S$)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For any process, the change in entropy is defined by:</p>\n$$ dS \\ge \\frac{dQ}{T} $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Reversible Process:</strong> $dS = \\frac{dQ_{rev}}{T}$. The change in entropy is equal to the heat transfer divided by the absolute temperature at the boundary where the heat transfer occurs.</li>\n    <li><strong>Irreversible Process:</strong> $dS > \\frac{dQ}{T}$. Real processes generate entropy due to irreversibilities like friction or unrestrained expansion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Isentropic Process:</strong> A process that is both adiabatic ($dQ=0$) and reversible is isentropic, meaning entropy remains constant ($dS=0$, or $s_1 = s_2$).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Principle of Increase of Entropy</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">For an isolated system (or the universe as a whole), the total entropy can never decrease. It increases for irreversible processes and remains constant for reversible processes.</p>\n$$ \\Delta S_{gen} \\ge 0 $$\n",
