Major Combustion Products</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The primary products of complete combustion of hydrocarbons are Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) and Water Vapor (H₂O). Nitrogen (N₂) from the air usually passes through unchanged but acts as a thermal diluent.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Pollutants and Byproducts</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Carbon Monoxide (CO):</strong> A colorless, odorless, toxic gas formed during incomplete combustion (insufficient oxygen). It binds to hemoglobin in blood, preventing oxygen transport.</li>\n    <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):</strong> A greenhouse gas that contributes to global climate change. It is an inevitable product of burning carbon-based fuels.</li>\n    <li><strong>Nitrogen Oxides (NOx):</strong> Includes NO and NO₂. Formed at very high combustion temperatures when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen (Thermal NOx). They contribute to smog (ground-level ozone) and acid rain.</li>\n    <li><strong>Sulfur Oxides (SOx):</strong> Primarily SO₂. Formed when sulfur-containing fuels (like coal or diesel) are burned. SOx is a major contributor to acid rain and respiratory problems.</li>\n    <li><strong>Particulate Matter (PM) and Ash:</strong> Solid or liquid particles suspended in the exhaust. Ash is the non-combustible mineral residue left after burning solid fuels like coal. Soot (unburned carbon) is also a particulate. PM can cause respiratory and cardiovascular health issues.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Control Strategies</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>CO and UHC:</strong> Ensure sufficient air (lean mixture) and good mixing. Use catalytic converters.</li>\n    <li><strong>NOx:</strong> Lower peak combustion temperatures (e.g., Exhaust Gas Recirculation, staged combustion) or use catalytic reduction (SCR).</li>\n    <li><strong>SOx:</strong> Use low-sulfur fuels or scrubbers (Flue Gas Desulfurization) to remove SOx from exhaust.</li>\n    <li><strong>Particulates:</strong> Use filters (like Diesel Particulate Filters), electrostatic precipitators, or baghouses.</li>\n</ul>\n",

        { "text": "Sulfur in the fuel reacts with nitrogen.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Thermal NOx formation is highly temperature-dependent. At high temperatures (typically above 1500°C), the triple bond in molecular nitrogen (N₂) breaks, allowing it to react with oxygen to form oxides of nitrogen."
