Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>Third Law of Thermodynamics</strong> relates to the behavior of systems as their temperature approaches absolute zero. It provides a definitive baseline for the determination of entropy.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Statement of the Third Law</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The law states:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"border-l-4 border-slate-300 pl-4 italic my-4\">\n    The entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero (0 Kelvin) is exactly equal to zero.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Explanation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness. At absolute zero, a perfect crystal has a perfectly ordered, unique ground state. All the atoms are in a fixed, regular lattice and have minimal vibrational energy. Since there is only one possible microscopic arrangement for the system, the disorder is zero, and thus the entropy is zero.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Implication: Unattainability of Absolute Zero</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">An important consequence of the Third Law is that it is impossible for any process, no matter how idealized, to reduce the temperature of a system to absolute zero in a finite number of finite steps. As a system approaches absolute zero, the amount of work required to extract a given amount of heat becomes infinitely large.</p>\n",

      "explanation": "The unattainability of absolute zero is a key corollary of the Third Law. As a system's temperature approaches 0 K, its entropy approaches zero, and the process of removing further heat to cool it down becomes progressively, and ultimately infinitely, difficult."
