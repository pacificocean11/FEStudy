Risk vs. Uncertainty</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In engineering economics, distinctions are often made between risk and uncertainty:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> A situation where the possible outcomes are known, and the probability of occurrence for each outcome can be estimated (e.g., rolling a die, historical weather data).</li>\n    <li><strong>Uncertainty:</strong> A situation where the possible outcomes may or may not be known, but the probabilities of occurrence are unknown or cannot be reasonably estimated.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Expected Value (EV)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">When probabilities are known (risk), the <strong>Expected Value</strong> (or Expected Monetary Value, EMV) is used to compare alternatives. It is the probability-weighted average of all possible outcomes.</p>\n$$ E[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i P(x_i) $$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$x_i$: The value of outcome $i$ (e.g., profit or cost).</li>\n    <li>$P(x_i)$: The probability of outcome $i$ occurring.</li>\n    <li>$\\sum P(x_i) = 1$.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Sensitivity Analysis</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong> determines how sensitive a decision or economic measure (like NPW or IRR) is to changes in key parameters (e.g., initial cost, interest rate, salvage value). It involves changing one variable at a time while holding others constant to see the effect on the outcome.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Breakeven Analysis</strong> is a form of sensitivity analysis that finds the value of a parameter that causes the project to just break even ($NPW=0$).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Decision Trees</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A graphical tool used to analyze sequential decisions under risk. Square nodes represent decisions, and circular nodes represent chance events. The tree is analyzed backwards (from right to left) by calculating the expected value at each chance node.</p>\n",
