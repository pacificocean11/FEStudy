Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Cost-Benefit Analysis</strong> is a systematic process for calculating and comparing the benefits and costs of a project or decision. The primary goal is to determine if the benefits outweigh the costs, and by how much. It is widely used in public sector projects where benefits can be social and not just monetary.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Benefit-Cost (B/C) Ratio</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The most common metric used in cost-benefit analysis is the Benefit-Cost (B/C) Ratio. All benefits and costs must be converted to a common equivalent monetary unit, such as Present Worth (PW) or Equivalent Annual Worth (EAW).</p>\n$$ B/C = \\frac{\\text{Equivalent Worth of Benefits}}{\\text{Equivalent Worth of Costs}} $$\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Decision Rule</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The decision rule for a single project is:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>If $B/C \\ge 1.0$, the project is economically justified, as the benefits are greater than or equal to the costs.</li>\n    <li>If $B/C < 1.0$, the project is not economically justified.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Comparing Alternatives</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">When comparing two mutually exclusive alternatives (A and B, where B has a higher initial cost), an incremental B/C analysis should be performed.</p>\n$$ \\Delta (B/C) = \\frac{\\text{Benefits}_B - \\text{Benefits}_A}{\\text{Costs}_B - \\text{Costs}_A} = \\frac{\\Delta B}{\\Delta C}$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">If $\\Delta (B/C) \\ge 1$, then the additional investment in alternative B is justified, so choose B. Otherwise, choose A.</p>\n",

        { "text": "No, because the ratio is not high enough.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Yes, because the B/C ratio is greater than or equal to 1.0.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "No, because the costs are too high.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Cannot be determined from the B/C ratio alone.", "isCorrect": false }

      "explanation": "The decision rule for a single project is that if the B/C ratio is 1.0 or greater, the project's benefits outweigh its costs, and it is considered economically acceptable."
