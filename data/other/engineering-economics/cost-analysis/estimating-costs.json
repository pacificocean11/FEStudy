Estimates are made at various stages of a project, with increasing levels of accuracy as more information becomes available.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Common Estimation Methods</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Unit Method (Per Unit):</strong> The most common preliminary method. The total cost is estimated by multiplying the number of units by an average cost per unit based on historical data. (e.g., Cost = Square Footage × Cost per Sq Ft).</li>\n    <li><strong>Cost Indices:</strong> Used to adjust costs for changes in time (inflation) or location. A cost index is a dimensionless number that tracks the change in cost of a market basket of goods.\n        $$ C_2 = C_1 \\left( \\frac{I_2}{I_1} \\right) $$\n        <ul class=\"list-circle list-inside ml-6\">\n            <li>$C_2$: Estimated cost at time/location 2.</li>\n            <li>$C_1$: Known cost at time/location 1.</li>\n            <li>$I_2, I_1$: Index values for time/location 2 and 1.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Power-Sizing Model (Capacity Factor):</strong> Used to estimate the cost of industrial equipment or plants based on a known cost of a similar item with a different capacity.\n        $$ \\frac{C_A}{C_B} = \\left( \\frac{S_A}{S_B} \\right)^x $$\n        <ul class=\"list-circle list-inside ml-6\">\n            <li>$C_A, C_B$: Cost of plant A and B.</li>\n            <li>$S_A, S_B$: Size (capacity) of plant A and B.</li>\n            <li>$x$: Power-sizing exponent (typically between 0.6 and 0.7, often called the 'six-tenths rule').</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n",

      "question": "A warehouse constructed in 2010 cost $500,000. The cost index in 2010 was 200, and the current cost index is 300. What is the estimated cost to build the same warehouse today?",
