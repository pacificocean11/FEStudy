Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Equivalent Annual Worth (EAW)</strong>, or Annual Worth (AW), converts all cash flows of a project into a single, equivalent uniform annual series over the project life. It is particularly useful for comparing alternatives with <strong>different useful lives</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Key Factors</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>(A/P, i, n) - Capital Recovery Factor:</strong> Converts a present amount ($P$) into an equivalent uniform annual series ($A$). Ideally used to annualize the initial cost.\n    $$ A = P \\left[ \\frac{i(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n - 1} \\right] $$</li>\n    <li><strong>(A/F, i, n) - Sinking Fund Factor:</strong> Converts a future amount ($F$) into an equivalent uniform annual series ($A$). Used for salvage values.\n    $$ A = F \\left[ \\frac{i}{(1+i)^n - 1} \\right] $$</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Comparing Unequal Lives</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">When comparing projects with different lifespans (e.g., Machine A lasts 5 years, Machine B lasts 10 years), you can simply calculate the Annual Worth of each machine over its own life. The assumption is that the asset will be replaced with an identical one at the end of its life (repeatability assumption). The machine with the lowest Equivalent Uniform Annual Cost (EUAC) or highest Annual Worth is selected.</p>\n",
