Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The <strong>Rate of Return (ROR)</strong> or Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the interest rate at which the present worth of the costs equals the present worth of the benefits. It is the interest rate ($i^*$) that makes the Net Present Worth (NPW) of the project equal to zero.</p>\n$$ NPW(i^*) = \\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\frac{CF_t}{(1+i^*)^t} = 0 $$\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return (MARR)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The MARR is the lowest return that a company is willing to accept on an investment. It represents the opportunity cost of capital.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Decision Rule</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>If $IRR \\ge MARR$, the project is economically justified.</li>\n    <li>If $IRR < MARR$, the project is not economically justified.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Calculation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Calculating IRR usually involves trial and error (interpolation) unless using a financial calculator or spreadsheet. You guess an interest rate, calculate the NPW, and adjust the rate until NPW is zero.</p>\n",
