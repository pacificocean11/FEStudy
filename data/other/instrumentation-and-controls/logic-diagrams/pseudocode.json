Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\"><strong>Pseudocode</strong> is a method of describing a computer algorithm or control logic using structured English (or another human language) that resembles a programming language but ignores specific syntax rules. It allows engineers to focus on the logic of the algorithm without worrying about punctuation or specific command names.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Common Structures</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Sequence:</strong> Steps are executed one after another.<br><em>Example:</em> Set Valve = Open; Wait 5 seconds.</li>\n    <li><strong>Selection (Conditional):</strong> Making a choice based on a condition.<br><em>Example:</em> IF (Temp > 100) THEN Alarm = ON; ELSE Alarm = OFF; ENDIF</li>\n    <li><strong>Iteration (Loops):</strong> Repeating a set of steps.<br><em>Example:</em> WHILE (Level < 90) DO Pump = ON; ENDWHILE</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Benefits</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Pseudocode bridges the gap between a flowchart and the final code. It is easier to read and write than actual code, making it an excellent tool for planning and documenting complex logic before implementation.</p>\n",
