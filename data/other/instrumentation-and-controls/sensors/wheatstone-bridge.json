Concept</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>Wheatstone bridge</strong> is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown electrical resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of which includes the unknown component. Its primary application in instrumentation is to measure the very small resistance changes produced by sensors like strain gages.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Circuit Diagram and Balancing</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The bridge consists of four resistors ($R_1, R_2, R_3, R_x$) arranged in a diamond shape, with a voltage source ($V_{in}$) applied across two opposite corners and a voltmeter ($V_{out}$) across the other two corners.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The bridge is said to be <strong>balanced</strong> when the output voltage $V_{out}$ is zero. This occurs when the ratio of resistances in the two legs is equal:</p>\n$$\\frac{R_2}{R_1} = \\frac{R_x}{R_3}$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">If three of the resistances are known, this equation can be used to find the value of the unknown resistor $R_x$.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Application with Strain Gages</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In sensor applications, one or more of the resistors are replaced by a sensor. For example, $R_x$ could be a strain gage. Initially, the bridge is balanced so $V_{out} = 0$. When the strain gage is subjected to strain, its resistance changes slightly, causing the bridge to become unbalanced and producing a small, non-zero output voltage $V_{out}$. This output voltage is proportional to the change in resistance, and therefore proportional to the strain.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Using multiple active strain gages in the bridge (e.g., a full-bridge configuration) can increase sensitivity and cancel out temperature effects.</p>\n",
