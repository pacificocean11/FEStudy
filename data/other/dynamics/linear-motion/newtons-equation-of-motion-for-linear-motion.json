      "question": "A 50 kg crate is pushed across a horizontal floor with a horizontal force of 200 N. The coefficient of kinetic friction is $\\mu_k = 0.3$. What is the acceleration of the crate? (Use $g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$).",

      "explanation": "First, find the friction force. The normal force balances the weight: $N = mg = 50(9.81) = 490.5$ N. Friction $f_k = \\mu_k N = 0.3(490.5) = 147.15$ N. Now apply $\\sum F_x = ma_x$: $F_{push} - f_k = ma$. $200 - 147.15 = 50a$. $52.85 = 50a \\implies a \\approx 1.057$ m/s²."
