Newton's Second Law for Rotation</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Newton's Second Law for linear motion ($F = ma$) has a direct analog for rotational motion.

      ],
      "explanation": "Use the rotational analog of Newton's Second Law: $\\tau = I\\alpha$ (or $\\sum M = I\\alpha$). Rearranging for angular acceleration: $\\alpha = \\tau / I = 20 \\text{ N·m} / 4 \\text{ kg·m²} = 5 \\text{ rad/s²}$."

      "question": "If the moment of inertia of a rotating body is doubled while the applied torque remains constant, what happens to the angular acceleration?",
      "options": [
        { "text": "It doubles.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "It remains the same.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "It is halved.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "It quadruples.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "From the equation $\\alpha = \\tau / I$, angular acceleration is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia. If $I$ doubles, $\\alpha$ becomes half of its original value."
