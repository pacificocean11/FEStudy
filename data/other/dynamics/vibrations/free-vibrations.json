Damped Free Vibration</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In real systems, energy is dissipated by forces like friction. This is modeled by adding a viscous damper (dashpot) with damping coefficient $c$.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The equation of motion is:</p>\n$$m\\ddot{x} + c\\dot{x} + kx = 0$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The behavior depends on the <strong>damping ratio ($\\zeta$)</strong>, which compares the actual damping to the critical damping value:</p>\n$$\\zeta = \\frac{c}{c_{cr}} = \\frac{c}{2\\sqrt{km}} = \\frac{c}{2m\\omega_n}$$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Underdamped ($\\zeta < 1$):</strong> The system oscillates with a decaying amplitude. This is the most common case of vibration. The damped natural frequency is $\\omega_d = \\omega_n\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$.</li>\n    <li><strong>Critically Damped ($\\zeta = 1$):</strong> The system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating.</li>\n    <li><strong>Overdamped ($\\zeta > 1$):</strong> The system returns to equilibrium slowly without oscillating.</li>\n</ul>\n",
