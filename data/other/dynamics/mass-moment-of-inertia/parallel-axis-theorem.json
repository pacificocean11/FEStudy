      "question": "A thin rod of mass $m$ and length $L$ has a moment of inertia $I_G = \\frac{1}{12}mL^2$ about its center. What is its moment of inertia about an axis at one end of the rod?",

        { "text": "$\\frac{1}{12}mL^2$", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "$\\frac{1}{4}mL^2$", "isCorrect": false },

        { "text": "$\\frac{1}{2}mL^2$", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Use the parallel axis theorem: $I = I_G + md^2$. The distance from the center to the end is $d = L/2$. So, $I = \\frac{1}{12}mL^2 + m(\\frac{L}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{12}mL^2 + \\frac{1}{4}mL^2 = \\frac{1}{12}mL^2 + \\frac{3}{12}mL^2 = \\frac{4}{12}mL^2 = \\frac{1}{3}mL^2$."

      "question": "Why is the moment of inertia about the center of mass ($I_G$) always the minimum moment of inertia among all parallel axes?",
      "options": [
        { "text": "Because the mass is smallest there.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Because the Parallel Axis Theorem adds a positive term ($md^2$) for any other axis.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "It isn't always the minimum.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Because $d$ is negative for other axes.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The term $md^2$ is always positive (since mass is positive and distance squared is positive). Therefore, $I = I_G + \\text{positive number}$, meaning $I$ will always be greater than $I_G$ for any distance $d > 0$."
