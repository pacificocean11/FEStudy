Conservative and Non-conservative Forces</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>A <strong>conservative force</strong> is a force for which the work done in moving a particle between two points is independent of the path taken. Examples include gravity and the force from an ideal spring. Potential energy can only be defined for conservative forces.</li>\n    <li>A <strong>non-conservative force</strong> is a force for which the work done depends on the path taken. Friction is the most common example. Work done by non-conservative forces dissipates energy from the system, usually as heat.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Conservation of Mechanical Energy</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The total mechanical energy ($E$) of a system is the sum of its kinetic energy ($KE$) and potential energy ($PE$).</p>\n$$E = KE + PE$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The law of conservation of mechanical energy states that if <strong>only conservative forces</strong> do work within an isolated system, the total mechanical energy of the system remains constant.</p>\n$$E_{initial} = E_{final}$$\n$$KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 + mgh_i + \\frac{1}{2}kx_i^2 = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh_f + \\frac{1}{2}kx_f^2$$\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Work Done by Non-conservative Forces</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">If non-conservative forces (like friction or air resistance) are present, mechanical energy is not conserved. The work done by these non-conservative forces ($W_{nc}$) is equal to the change in the total mechanical energy of the system.</p>\n$$W_{nc} = \\Delta E = E_f - E_i = (KE_f + PE_f) - (KE_i + PE_i)$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Since friction always opposes motion, the work it does is negative, leading to a decrease in the system's mechanical energy.</p>\n",

      "question": "A 2 kg pendulum is released from rest at a height of 0.5 m above its lowest point. Ignoring air resistance, what is its speed at the lowest point of its swing? (Use $g=9.8$ m/s²).",

      "explanation": "We can use conservation of energy. Let the initial state (i) be at the top and the final state (f) be at the bottom. At the top, $v_i = 0$ and $h_i = 0.5$ m. At the bottom, we set the reference height $h_f = 0$. $KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f \\implies 0 + mgh_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + 0$. The mass cancels out: $gh_i = \\frac{1}{2}v_f^2$. Solving for $v_f$: $v_f = \\sqrt{2gh_i} = \\sqrt{2(9.8)(0.5)} = \\sqrt{9.8} \\approx 3.13 \\text{ m/s}$."

      ],
      "explanation": "Since there is friction, mechanical energy is not conserved. We use $W_{nc} = E_f - E_i$. The work done by friction is the energy lost. Initial energy: $E_i = KE_i + PE_i = 0 + mgh = (10)(9.8)(5) = 490$ J. Final energy: $E_f = KE_f + PE_f = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + 0 = \\frac{1}{2}(10)(8)^2 = 5(64) = 320$ J. The work done by friction is $W_{friction} = E_f - E_i = 320 - 490 = -170$ J. The energy lost is the magnitude of this work, 170 J."
