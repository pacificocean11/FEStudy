  "notes": "\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">1. Ohm's Law</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Ohm's Law is a fundamental relationship in electrical circuits. It states that the voltage ($V$) across a resistor is directly proportional to the current ($I$) flowing through it. The constant of proportionality is the resistance ($R$).</p>\n$$ V = IR $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This equation can be rearranged to solve for any of the three variables:\n    <br>$I = V/R$\n    <br>$R = V/I$\n</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Conductance (G)</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance. It is a measure of how easily current flows through a material.</p>\n$$ G = \\frac{1}{R} $$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The unit of conductance is the <strong>Siemens (S)</strong>. In terms of conductance, Ohm's law can be written as $I = GV$.</p>\n",
