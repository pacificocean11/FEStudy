Power in Three-Phase Systems</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The total power in a balanced three-phase system is the sum of the power in each of the three phases. The advantage of three-phase power is that the total instantaneous power is constant, which results in smoother operation for large motors.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Total Power Formulas</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The formulas for total active power ($P$), reactive power ($Q$), and apparent power ($S$) in a balanced three-phase system are given in terms of <strong>line quantities</strong> ($V_L, I_L$). These formulas work for both Wye and Delta connected loads.</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li><strong>Total Active Power (P):</strong> The real power consumed by the load, measured in Watts (W).</li>\n    $$ P = \\sqrt{3} V_L I_L \\cos(\\phi) $$\n    <li><strong>Total Reactive Power (Q):</strong> The power that oscillates between the source and the load, measured in Volt-Amps Reactive (VAR).</li>\n    $$ Q = \\sqrt{3} V_L I_L \\sin(\\phi) $$\n    <li><strong>Total Apparent Power (S):</strong> The vector sum of active and reactive power, measured in Volt-Amps (VA).</li>\n    $$ S = \\sqrt{3} V_L I_L = \\sqrt{P^2 + Q^2} $$\n</ul>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In these formulas, $\\phi$ is the phase angle of the load impedance, and $\\cos(\\phi)$ is the <strong>power factor (PF)</strong>.</p>\n",
