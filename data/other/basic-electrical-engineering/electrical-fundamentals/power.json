  "notes": "\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">1. Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Electrical power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. It is the amount of energy consumed per unit of time.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Formulas</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The primary formula for power ($P$) is the product of voltage ($V$) and current ($I$):</p>\n$$P = VI$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">By substituting Ohm's Law ($V = IR$) into the primary power formula, two other common forms can be derived:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>Substitute $V=IR$: $P = (IR)I = I^2R$</li>\n    <li>Substitute $I=V/R$: $P = V(\\frac{V}{R}) = \\frac{V^2}{R}$</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Unit of Power</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The SI unit of power is the <strong>watt (W)</strong>, named after James Watt. One watt is defined as one joule of energy per second.</p>\n$$1 \\text{ W} = 1 \\frac{\\text{Joule}}{\\text{second}} = 1 \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{s}}$$\n<p class=\"mb-4\">In electrical terms, one watt is the power dissipated when one ampere of current flows through a potential difference of one volt.</p>\n$$1 \\text{ W} = 1 \\text{ V} \\cdot 1 \\text{ A}$$\n",
