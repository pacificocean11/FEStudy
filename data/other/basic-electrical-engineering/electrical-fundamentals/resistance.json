Materials that offer high resistance are called insulators, while materials that offer low resistance are called conductors.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Ohm's Law</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Ohm's Law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. The constant of proportionality is the resistance.</p>\n$$V = IR$$\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Unit of Resistance</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The SI unit of electrical resistance is the <strong>ohm (\u03A9)</strong>, named after Georg Simon Ohm. One ohm is the resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of one volt, applied to these points, produces a current of one ampere.</p>\n$$1 \\; \u03A9 = 1 \\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{A}}$$\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Resistivity</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The resistance of a material depends on its geometry and an intrinsic property called resistivity. The formula is:</p>\n$$R = \\frac{\\rho L}{A}$$\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4\">\n    <li>$R$ is the resistance in ohms (\u03A9).</li>\n    <li>$\\rho$ (rho) is the electrical resistivity of the material in ohm-meters (\u03A9\u00B7m).</li>\n    <li>$L$ is the length of the material in meters (m).</li>\n    <li>$A$ is the cross-sectional area of the material in square meters (m$^2$).</li>\n</ul>\n",
