Definition</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Electric charge is the fundamental physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. There are two types of electric charge: positive and negative. Like charges repel each other, and opposite charges attract.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">2. Unit of Charge</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The SI unit of electric charge is the <strong>coulomb (C)</strong>. It is a very large unit of charge.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">3. Elementary Charge</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The smallest unit of charge observed in nature is the elementary charge, denoted by $e$. The charge of a single proton is $+e$, and the charge of a single electron is $-e$. All free charges are integer multiples of this elementary charge.</p>\n$$e \\approx 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}$$\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">4. Conservation of Charge</h3>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">The principle of conservation of charge states that the net electric charge in an isolated system remains constant. Charge is not created or destroyed; it is only transferred from one object to another.</p>\n",
